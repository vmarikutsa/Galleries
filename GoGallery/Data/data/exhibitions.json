    "about": "Rothschild Fine Art is pleased to present Ido Markus’s first solo exhibition at the Gallery.\r\nMore than one hundred small-scale to miniature works, moving between the abstract and the figurative, will comprise a new installation in the gallery space, conducting a varied dialogue with landscape painting and various theories of painting.\r\nThe title, “Glitch,” is a term from experimental electronic music that developed in the late 1990s, characterizing a thoughtful, slow style. “Glitch” uses sounds generated as vocal side effects produced from the faulty functioning of digital electronics and electrical equipment.\r\nMarKus’s painting corresponds with this musical genre. His artwork arises from his connection and love for traditional classical painting, while, on the other hand, his local environment, so overloaded and noisy, impacts his creative process.\r\nExhibition opens Thursday, March 17, 2016, at 8 p.m. to 10 p.m.\r\nGallery talk will take place on Friday 15/4/16 at 12:00 pm",

Always. James Joyce took the \r\nfurthest right? Finnegans Wake, an unreadable book that has stretched \r\nwords and letters to the fullest. But words without letters? A form \r\nwith no structure? Just the question as a thought is enough for me. \r\nPainting without marks of paint. Food without ingredients. Can this \r\nmagic be made? Is this what Romy means? Is this what he wants to \r\nknow? Can there be something made without the ingredients of that \r\nthing? Is this what our ultimate aim is? Who am I to say? \r\nIs this is what painting now is? It has to be a form with no structure, \r\na word without letters, letters without a word, two new words that \r\nmake a third. The irreconcilable, the holding of opposing poles \r\nsimultaneously.

    "authorDescription": "The Israeli painter Maya Gold (*1978 in Jerusalem) lives and works in Tel Aviv. She received her education at the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design Jerusalem and Tel Aviv as well as the Slade School of Fine Art, London. Since 2003 Maya Golds’ works were presented in solo and group exhibitions in Israel and the United States.\r\nMaya Gold‘s paintings we sometimes observe a grid of horizontal and vertical lines. This grid, reminiscent of a painterly apparatus meant to aid artists in organizing their canvas, is brought in Gold‘s paintings to the fore. Rather than disappear behind the painting‘s surface, it is suggested by the objects and landscapes on view. This somewhat playful materialization of the painting‘s scaffolding may also imply that the realm represented therein has willingly succumbed to the rules of the perspectival net cast over it.(…)\r\nMost of all, in Gold‘s paintings it is a flat, cleverly structured sfumato of clouds that hinders the materialization of an accountable universe. Whether hinted at by their ominous shadows cast on firm ground or watery surfaces, or suggested by their reflection in glass; or whether painted directly — as in the thick nebulous formation enveloping two lonely ship masts above a stormy sea — it is often the clouds that are at the basis of both the doing and undoing of what is encrypted in the paintings. Thus, even a series of fantastic views in different shades, with sparse clouds hanging above an idyllic lake, offers less of a romantic escapade and more of an equivocal yet melancholic play on the reversibility of planes",

    "authorDescription": "Lyle Ashton Harris (born 1965, New York) lives and works in New York. He received his Bachelor of Arts with Honors from Wesleyan University in 1988 and a Masters in Fine Arts from the California Institute of the Arts in 1990, and is an Associate Professor at New York University. His work has been exhibited internationally, including at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York and the 52nd Venice Biennale. His work has been acquired by major international museums, most recently by the Museum of Modern Art, New York. In 2014 Harris joined the board of trustees at the American Academy in Rome and was named the 10th recipient of the David C. Driskell Prize by the High Museum of Art in Atlanta.",
    "about": "In his first solo show at Sommer Contemporary Art, American artist Lyle Ashton Harris will exhibit a new series of photomontages and a select set of recent chromogenic prints from his Archive series exploring intersections of the personal and the political. Harris is known internationally for his diverse artistic practice, ranging from photographic media, collage, installation and performance, which examine the contemporary impact of ethnicity, gender and desire across multiple social and cultural spheres.\r\n Twenty-two chromogenic prints selected from Harris’s personal archive of 35mm Ektachrome color reversal slides that capture intimate moments among the artist’s close circle throughout the 1980s and 1990s will be shown, spanning locales from New York and Los Angeles to London, Berlin and Rome. Among those portrayed are notable artists, writers and filmmakers, including Nan Goldin, Isaac Julian, Renée Cox, Essex Hemphill, and Iké Udé, in addition to candid self-portraits of Harris himself. As a unique document of the late 20th century life, these works bear witness to fleeting moments throughout a period of seismic shifts across the social, political and artistic landscape, with the emergence of multiculturalism and nascent globalization, the second wave of AIDS activism, and the imbrication of the contemporary art scene with LGBT and African diaspora communities, the expanded impact of which is felt worldwide.\r\n The exhibition will also include six large photomontages comprised of dense image clusters—juxtaposing media images, art historical references, political and entertainment figures, unique Polaroid prints, newspaper clippings, and re-photographed images of the artist’s works among other personal ephemera—evoke complex, layered associations excavated from collective memory. These striking new pieces emerged from a set of collage studies originally developed by Harris to explore the African Baroque, published in the catalogue of “Nero su Bianco”, a 2015 exhibition exploring contemporary and historical cross-currents of Italian and African influence, co-curated by Harris, fellow artist and critic Robert Storr, and Peter Benson Miller at the American Academy in Rome.\r\n By exhibiting this recent series of photomontages in conjunction with the Ektachrome Archive, Harris seeks to evoke a space in which temporalities collide, disrupting notions of history and memory as mere repositories, while activating their potential to reimagine a multiplicity of narrative readings.\r\n Harris was featured in the Project Room of Sommer Contemporary Art in 2015 with “Mapping Desire”, a selection of photographs spanning 1996-2014.",

    "about": "Pleased to announce Elad Rosen's first solo exhibition at Rosenfeld gallery. Rosen, recipient of the Ministry of Culture and Sport’s Young Artist prize of 2015, will show recent paintings that rely on a playful, childlike aesthetic. The paintings are inspired by the video games of the 80's, a virtual space that was as real and intense as any other tangible landscape of Rosen's childhood.   \r\n\r\nThe different works present a repetitive imagery that deals in slapstick, dark humor and an excess of emotion. Limbs, faces, fruit and geometric shapes form together popy, expressive and misleading compositions, where the sweet, joyful appearance turns into a grotesque and terrifying one. A face that seems at first glance to be naïve becomes a disturbing Pinocchio, in an emotional exaggeration that is hard to take seriously and yet is impossible to resist. \r\n\r\nPleased to announce Karam Natour's exhibition: \"Following No Mythologies\" that will inaugurate the \"Rosy\", the new project room at the gallery. In his exhibition Karam is presenting a new series of about 20 digital drawings that were made during the previous year by Jester.\r\n\r\nJester is the name of an entity that shares the same physical body with the artist, but functions according to a complete different set of mental constructions. This entity, Jester, is the one that created the series of works that are shown in the exhibition. \r\n\r\nThe drawings often portray a nude male figure that resembles the artist himself being positioned in certain situations that create the narrative in the drawing. The physical presence of the body is a recurring motif in Jester’s works, emphasizing on the allegorical connotations that the physical body has. Jester often approaches the figure of the artist in his drawing with cynicism, humor, playfulness, and sarcasm.",

    "about": "Noga Gallery is delighted to present sculptures and paintings by Chanan de Lange created in 2013-2015.\r\n \r\nThe exhibition’s title alludes to an in-between state, the elusive moment between darkness and light, when the sky is still blue but the landscape is getting darker, like the in-between that exists in de Lange’s artworks throughout his artistic career. Since his graduation and throughout his work as a designer, planner, architect, de Lange engages in a profound dialogue with visual art.\r\n \r\nMarcel Duchamp created a distinction between the “ready-made” and “objet trouvé” (found object), which the artist discovers and chooses due to its singular qualities. The ready-made is usually one object of many, produced in mass assembly line, a nondescript object. Andre Breton defined the ready-made as “an industrial object elevated to the dignity of a work of art by the mere choice of an artist”.\r\n \r\nChanan de Lange’s studio houses hundreds or thousands of ready-made parts alongside items collected over the years with love and care, objects with past and history, with cultural values of their own and very specific associations to the life of de Lange, which serve as a reservoir of memories, or as the painter’s palette.\r\n \r\nChanan de Lange is a Dadaist artist, the spirit and freedom of Dada artist is blowing between his works, characterized by a playful and tongue in cheek tone. Marcel Duchamp had said: “I enjoy looking at the bicycle wheel, it has a pleasing and comforting aspect”. De Lange’s pleasure in the creation process, the freedom with which he operates, breathes life, forms relationships, re-creates, creates two and three dimensional works, full of humor, movement, and imagination. The connection between the different elements forms a new syntax that imbues them with fresh, personal and universal meanings.\r\n \r\nThe exhibition also includes works on canvas originating in curtains, in some of the canvases there is a use of light. The works on canvas, like the sculptures, stress the engagement with liminal moments, and correspond in a different manner with that hinted in-between.\r\n \r\nProfessor Chanan de Lange graduated with honors from Bezalel Department of Industrial Design. He has been an active designer since 1985 and a teacher at Bezalel since 1988.

    "about": "Jonathan Goldman’s artworks walk the fine line between science and art and between imagination and reality. Immersing himself in exploration and observation, he follows the occurrences taking place in the studio to new places, allowing the works to undergo a process of transformation, or as the artist refers to it – evolution. \r\n\r\nThe exhibition Back to Shore traces the evolutionary process in his works by presenting select works from previous projects alongside new works. The process started in his exploration into the link between sound and shape, engendered the image of the floating mountains, evolved into the idea of a lab for growing new continents, and from there to a journey at sea on a raft and back to the notion of borders and a new interest in the maps of Israel. This is a rare opportunity to experience the artist’s body of work in its full context, allowing entry into his process of exploring, a journey of thoughts and ideas that started with his graduation three years ago, and goes on to this day. \r\n\r\nCurator: Yaron Haramati",
    "authorDescription": "Born in Ramat Hasharon, 1984.\r\nLives and works in Tel Aviv.\r\n “Artistic practice for me is a process of transformation and a complete disconnection from any aim”\r\nIn his work, Goldman combines asphalt, chemical laboratory materials, plant roots, and readymade objects with electronic equipment, LED lights and sound sensors. His work process challenges conventional techniques and materials, implementing experiments that stretch the boundaries of the media in which he works. \r\nIt is the encounter with the materials, the dynamic work process, and the transformations that occur in the work from the formulation of the concept to the finished object, that fascinate Goldman and constitute the heart of his artistic practice.\r\nIn his work process, Goldman uses drawing as a point of departure for translating images that capture his imagination into the visual dimension. Henceforth, the original meaning of the images becomes fluid and they undergo a transformation that develops them into objects.\r\nIn his installations Goldman uses loudspeakers that emit sounds that have been recorded and processed from the environments in which he lives and works. Like the visual images in his work, which are composed of both memories and random daily encounters, the sounds can also be either recordings of voices from Goldman’s autobiographical past, from the natural environment, or sounds created during the installation’s development.\r\nThe sound sensors, the lighting and the organic materials and unique sound that make up the work come together to form a unit with an inner engine, an engine that feeds on energy and on acts of conversion and transformation. The resulting rhythms that accompany the site-specific installations connect the objects in the space, while the loudspeakers serve as a kind of sound box for the creative process itself.\r\n \r\nGoldman regards art as a testing ground for researching relationships in reality, proposing an alternative underlain by optimism and naïveté, a natural habitat for new continents.",

    "about": "Naama Roth's Architexture bridges the experiential dissonance between installation, artwork and gallery space. Through the use of industrial materials, including masking tape, plywood, wallpaper and plastic, Roth creates abstract geometric images on canvas and via video and installation. Architexture blurs the juxtaposing lines of precision in the calculated aesthetic of building with the raw creative process of trial and error, and features never-before-seen works by the artist created specifically for the exhibition.\r\n\r\nNaama Roth highlights the beauty within the imperfection that is paramount to the creative process. Often times, the gritty elements of infrastructure are concealed in the final incarnation. Architexture challenges the viewer to question what is more \"real\": the materials used to create or the finished artwork which silences the wave of the creative process. In Architexture, the industrial materials are used to portray an almost unfinished aesthetic. By implementing the industrial materials into the installation, Roth chooses to expose the materials rather than exploit them. Roth brings the behind the scenes elements of creation to the forefront of the visual experience by deconstructing the notion of a finished project and exposing the raw elements of composition.",

    "about": "In his first solo exhibition at Sommer Contemporary Art, Croatian artist David Maljković continues to explore the erosion of time and the corruption of information through a layering of formal investigations.\r\n \r\nThe exhibition follows a mirroring logic, in which manipulated images repeat in different constellations and media. On the two central polls of the gallery, two slide projectors rattle. The first is projecting In Low Resolution (2014) – a rotation of 40 slides, taken from the artist's personal archive and depicting his earlier works and installations. The images are manipulated, so that the quality of specific objects and areas are reduced to large indiscernible pixels.\r\n \r\nOne of the slides, showing a hand trying to catch a floating white pixelated object, is projected, still and isolated, on the second poll. Called Afterform (2013), this image is indeed chasing its various forms, as it is translated again in to wallpapers. These function as backgrounds for two large collages, made of photographs documenting various creative stages of Maljković’s works, laid on top of one another. Their title - New Reproduction (2013), enfolds a temporal paradox. Through digital editing, decollaging, covering and hiding, the artist reactivates his previous works in a kind of a timeline gone-bad. These scrambled hyper-images are framed by KODAK professional quality-control printing scales, as if they were printing tests. Two other wallpapers are in fact over-sized installation shots of Maljković’s 2014 show at the Palais de Tokyo, called 'In Low Resolution'. Rather than transforming the gallery space, they function as ghosts from a former installation.\r\n \r\nIn a complex play of dislocation and reversed time, Maljković now uses the wallpaper's two-dimensional image of a white empty screen as a projection space for a new version of his famous video work, Out of Projection (2009-2014). Filmed at the test track of Peugeot headquarters in the French city of Sochaux, it shows elderly people walking around the track, along side futurist cars models designed in the 1980-2000s. The image is blurred and the movement is slowed down to suggest a dream-like aesthetic or surveillance footage. The people are actual retired Peugeot workers, some visiting the carefully guarded track for the first time. Their bodies act as a temporal division, while the car models, which now seem as if they were taken from an old sci-fi film, are stranded in a limbo of outdated futures. On a different wall, covered by the same wallpaper, a still from the original film is shown. Here, Maljković stopped the printing of the image before the heads of the figures were injected onto the paper, thus creating headless specters.\r\n \r\nMaljković’s work deals with formalist concerns through highly controlled variants. While narrative is the driving element of his projects, the artist’s varied means of visual implementation challenge the supremacy of the story. Construction within a set of formal directives encrypts the narrative and postulates what Maljković describes \"a new semantic logic\". In aesthetic terms, his practice can be described as existing between form and content, or signifier and signified - in linguistic terms. It is within these dynamics that Maljković negotiates his formal methods and disjunctive intentions.",

    "authorDescription": "Elad Kopler, Robert Melee, Ted Pim, Gabriel J. Shuldiner, Jack R. Slentz, and Cullen Washington Jr.",
    "about": "Science tells us that dark matter is a mysterious unseen force that comprises most of the universe. So far immeasurable, it has a powerful effect on that which is visible and known.  The creative process is somewhat analogous in that it is presumed, but also unseen, yet impacts the physical world, making the invisible, visible.  \r\nThis gathering came about in an attempt to present several artists who follow an intuitive, sometimes aggressive approach in the making of art.  While formal references may abound and others foist upon them, all the works possess an organic origin, often unfathomable.  \r\nNot too long ago the paintings of Elad Kopler were vast scenes of destruction and upheaval rendered in a combination of the recognizable and the abstract.  The beautifully painted surfaces and abstracted passages obscured darker themes that reflected a very real physical experience.  Recent work has seen a reduction, a distillation that excises the narrative and focuses on color, shape and line that goes to the abstract core of the composition.  In a very real way he has found the path literally and figuratively ‘out of the rubble’ and into pure painting.\r\nPainter, sculptor, photographer, installation and performance artist Robert Melee’s work is not comprised of disparate elements, but is a holistic approach to the making of art.  The work is always self-referential and complex.  The bottle cap paintings, a series the artist first began in 1999, have become signature works.  The kitsch elements of the beer bottle caps are interwoven with plaster, enamel, paint creating an undulating surface.   The resultant abstraction provides a meditative mandala effect that transcends the humble materials.\r\nThe ethereal paintings of Ted Pim reference old master portraiture.  He began his painting career creating mural-scale works in the dark recesses of abandoned breweries, factories and schools, places where few, if any, got the chance to experience the work.  The distorted physiognomies rendered in ghostly tonalities emerge from a nearly black expanse to create a poetic, almost funereal imagery, channeling Goya and Francis Bacon.\r\n\r\nGabriel J. Shuldiner re-purposes the detritus of the world around us, bending, coaxing, twisting and forcing found and discarded objects and materials into a new existence.  A pseudo-trademarked amalgam of black pigments called ‘postapocalypticBLACK’ is Shuldiner’s secret ingredient in his alchemical process of turning base matter into a more precious substance. Despite the overriding insistence of the color black, the surfaces have a painterly quality, alternating between matte and sheen and sometimes injected with a tiny shock of fluorescent color.  The works move between monolithic statements of form to more free-flowing, seemingly fragile elements.",

    "about": "Urbanism is with-out a doubt one of the most important and influential phenomena of the twentieth and twenty first centuries. Artists, poets, writers, and philosophers are attracted to urbanism while channeling their fascination of this age to an active dialogue, a process of change in urban form which becomes a part of an artistic act.\r\nThe exhibition features a collection of works which embody these trends of observing and exploring the urban space, alongside with critique about our environment. The works in the show, by Liat Livni and Amir Tomashov, represent the current urban space in the age of globalization and the local social-political surroundings.\r\nAmir Tomashov’s works deal with criticism over our urban surroundings that were constructed in a repetitive, schematic way and lacking an architectural identity. Tomashov works in a similar way to an architect by using a reversal and multi-layered technique to dismantle the surface only to rebuild it again with a deference. While using a technique of sketching and paper stencil, he reveals more than the eye can see, this enhances the connection between architecture and art, together with using ‘Ready-Made’ such as old book covers and leftover wood from the street. In recent years the city which Tomashov lives and works is under a construction momentum, and he involves this in his work together with local architecture.\r\nLiat Livni is an artist who often deals with simple, disposable materials that lack any artistic aura such as paper and wood. With these she creates urban structures and landscape that bring together nature and culture. Following an artist residency in Taiwan, Livni created the series of works Windows of Modernity (2012) as a paraphrase on traditional wooden curved windows. Inside the objects, which were made of sand and glue, are mundane images of skyscrapers, industrial buildings, cable car and more. At first it seems that Livni follows a traditional approach in her work, but a closer look reveals complexity of destruction of the old world in favor of progress and western technology. Another work in the exhibition, Reading (2016), also deals with this duality, depicting the mythological Tel Aviv power station, once an urban symbol of air pollution, which has now become a green public space. \r\nIt seems that the fast changing reality, influenced by enormous economic and technological powers, effects on the way artists deal with their work. In a dynamic era that accelerate production, artists seek a way to involve their work with processes of urban construction and demolition in a new found boundaries. \r\nCurator: Meital Manor",

    "authorDescription": "Liat Livni\r\nAfter her stay in Taiwan, Liat Livni, an artist who often uses simple, perishable materials such as paper and wood, created the series “Windows of Modernity” (2012) as a paraphrase of the traditional carved wooden windows that are rapidly disappearing as the culture shifts and older buildings are destroyed to make way for new ones. Composed of sand, cardboard and gluing materials, the objects incorporate within them contemporary images including skyscrapers, industrial structures and a cable car. The artist, who appears at first glance to be maintaining tradition, deals with the destruction of the traditional world in favor of Western technological progress.\r\nAmir Tomashov\r\nCreating a non-place realm of imaginary experiences, Amir Tomashov presents a series of “architectural landscapes” - models, collages and sketches merging constructivist and deconstructivist dynamics crashing in space and speed. Far from the professional practice of the architect-builder, Tomashov researchs urban anatomies with a clinical look. He thinks in an utopian way FOR space, as if space had to be cared for, or even saved. As if our spatial experience was in imminent danger of being swallowed by an invisible force. Globalization erases memory, hence it erases Time and Space, as both experiences interact through our ability to remember. Tomashov’s ideal cities are far from being romantic. They project us, naked, into a post atomic cosmos of never-ending wandering, where ruined bits and pieces of cities and buildings do not offer any place to rest. Utopia meets apocalypse, thus becoming dystopia. Brutal, violent, and still, entirely redeemed by the power of poetry - the poetry of Amir’s artistic technique: a brilliant capacity for mixing media in blowing compositions, combining high-tech, architecture and craft into conceptual models, into pieces of dream - into pieces of art.",

    "about": "Curator: Leah Abir\r\n1.\tAll the Treadmills are Desperate\r\n\r\n2.\tThe Flat Diamond Café\r\n\r\nNir Segal's solo show marks a pivotal point in his artistic research during the last two years, conducted in the framework of his PhD studies at the Slade, London. The two works exhibited in this show stem from the investigation of one concept – \"The Flat Diamond\" – which stands at the core of the artist's practice and work in recent years. \"The Flat Diamond\" is a discursive term that is spread by word of mouth, acquiring meaning and context by its receivers through conversations, actions and hearsay. What exactly is this \"Flat Diamond\"? The many answers to this question are being accumulated with time, in a process that separates this potential object from its different possible narratives and myths of creation, existence and meaning.\r\nThe title of the show, \"Two Work,\" marks a duality inherent in this presentation – two works, two floors, collaboration between two artists and conversations between two people. The first work, All the Treadmills are Desperate, is shown at the gallery's main space in the 4th floor. It was produced, designed and programmed as an invitation for visitors to engage in conversation under specific conditions. Described by Segal as a \"conversation machine,\" this work is the outcome of a collaboration with choreographer and dancer Oded Graf, who is the artistic director of the international \"Yossi Berg and Oded Graf Dance Theater.\" \r\nThe second work, The Flat Diamond Café, is situated at the first floor of the same building. Similarly to \"All the Treadmills are Desperate,\" \"The Flat Diamond Café,\" might also be described as an installation with performative elements. 2 floors beneath the gallery space, Segal designed a small Café named after the thematic enigma of the flat diamond, in which he is hosting visitors throughout the show's opening hours, inviting them for coffee and initiating one-on-one conversations. \r\nBoth works displayed in this exhibition are based on duration and process. They function as visual and conceptual frameworks for a content that is slowly building up in action. They both focus on storytelling techniques and collaborative models, challenging them by introducing different rules and conditions, assigning a big role to the potential or actual actions of the viewer/visitor.\r\nThe exhibition is supported by: Maccabee Beer, Energym Sports, Electronit, Retro TLV, The Girls Like Food, Blumenwood, and Espresso Club, Yaya Productions\r\nSound Design: Shasho",

    "about": "There is nothing conventional about a performance of Ohtoh Olahm (English translation: The Same World).   Neither the mixture of the instruments, nor the sound, or the execution of the Israeli and English language songs.   The performance moves along serendipitously, like a conversation between friends who have met up for a drink in a bar.  When they talk they know not where their talk will take them—not what about, and not with what edge.  \r\nA performance of Ohtoh Olahm is a conversation among three people--Pesach, Avi, and Gabi—which by chance happens in the presence of an audience.\r\nThe planning is the necessary minimum, to meet at a time and place. Content and presentation take shape spontaneously in real time.  Dialogue is built, or collapses, in accordance with the mood of the moment.  There are no rehearsals.  They meet only for the sound check the evening of the performance.  This garners for the sound of Ohtoh Olahm an unexpected accumulative abstract materiality, forming a single work which moves toward infinity.\r\nThey have been playing together since 2009, with a fluid schedule of performances, avoiding definition or categorization of their type of music. \r\nPesach stands in the middle.  He plays his vocal chords, and on a percussion instrument, a “bell tree” from Pakistan, which he acquired in Michigan. He also plays a recorder and a theremin (an electronic instrument). Gabi is to Pesach’s left.  He uses a computer and a groove box. On the right, Avi plays an electric guitar.  \r\nGabi drives the groove and defines the texture of the sound, which provides the ground for Pesach’s singing, or speech, or reading.  Avi adds the backbeats, everything that is below the surface.   Gabi determines the language and the sound of the “conversation”. Pesach determines the continuity, the tone, the verbal component, and the abstract nuances.  Avi gives the grammar, the punctuation, and the emphases.\r\nIn their meeting, the slow, dark and hazy electronic sound, and Pesach’s high vocalizing, strike a conscious distance from anything that could be called harmonic, or expected, or beautiful.  The freedom with which Ohtoh Olahm uses known songs, some better known and some less, disassembles them and then remakes them into something new, and it makes their performance into something strange and at the same time nonchalant, by its chance quality.  Pesach makes a collage out of texts which he “cuts and pastes”.  Sometimes he sings a song and sometimes he speaks it.  He may begin with Hamburger Girl by the Linus Pauling Quartet.  He may follow with Rikdi (Dance) by Yishai Levi, giving it monotonic repetition, and then conclude with Chuck Berry’s Rock and Roll Music. The improvisation breaks up the normal hierarchy of voice and accompaniment.  It enables the members of the group to literally go out and return as it suits them.  (The same applies to the listeners\\spectators.)  If one of them gets up of a sudden the performance continues without him.  When he returns he reenters the flow.\r\nAlthough the three artists come from the same world, each, in his art, has different questions.  Such it is in the exhibition.  There is no pretense of an invented connection which is forced on the art.  Taking place in that space between painting, drawing, sculpture, performance and object, the exhibition is an attempt to adopt the unique dynamic of a performance of Ohtoh Olahm and apply it to the emplacement of the objects in the gallery space.   The curatorial endeavor lies in the combining of elements itself.  It adopts the free values of improvisation, which occasionally are tasteless or fragmentary.  The three-headed assemblage created in the space is anti-monumental.  It is replete with both the inter-breeding and the contradiction between art and craft, between the two- and the three-dimensional, between movement and stasis.  \r\nThe group has entrusted their anti-monumental sound to a fourth party, who is not party to their concept “platoon”, someone capable of observing the phenomenon from an outer vantage point.  Shay-Lee Uziel has made a work especially for this exhibition, an extended video clip which is screened again and again, continuously.   It combines anachronistic hi-tech esthetics with the electro-magnetic avant-garde.  This audio-visual collage replaces the live performance which does not take place in the exhibition.\r\nCurator: Tali Ben-Nun\r\nMusical closing Event will take place on Saturday - 14/5/16 at 19:30",

    "name": "Khen Shish \\ Tunisian Bride",
    "about": "Sea of Tears // Tali Tamir\r\nKhen Shish's Tunisian Bride, much like the bride in the well-known play by Nissim Aloni, joins an age-old array of brides who have dressed in their most elegant wedding gowns and as their veil fluttered above them, they fled from the altar to the mythical world of the archetypical bride. This bride, whose groom has never presented himself at her altar (and not the one who ran from her groom in Lorca's \"Blood Wedding\" – is somewhat of a tricky creature: abandoned and miserable on the one hand, yet at the same time – powerful, independent, and free. \r\nThe Tunisian Bride starring in Khen Shish's pink-black-golden painting, representing herself, is washed away by an ocean of tears; up in flames like a martyr, while simultaneously she grows to monumental dimensions, bedecked as befit to a Byzantine queen, she sprouts scorpion's pincers or peacock's wings. Khen rejects gracefulness: her image of the bride has become a ritual hybrid of man/animal, bride/bird of prey, pecking (perhaps) at her groom's liver. The primary pink space of her paintings, saccharine and flowing with hearts, is covered up by a rain of black tears and a flock of sharp-beaked eagles. \r\nThe tears receive quite a dramatic empowerment: if in Picasso's \"The Weeping Woman\" (1937) the tears are enlarged and have a crystal-like presence, in Shish's case, the tears are thick cardboard cutouts glued onto the scenic fabric, gaining a tangible, three-dimensional presence. \"An ocean of tears in my two eyes / my heart calls out return to me\" – Zohar Argov, the king of Middle Eastern song, sings dramatically to the words of Zmira Chen. \r\nIn her previous exhibition, Khen Shish's art spoke of a broken heart calling out for its disappeared lover to return. In the current exhibition, the heart is presented in place of the head, and the tears join in a Bacchanal circle dance. Is the Middle Eastern characteristic of Khen Shish – \"The Tunisian\" – not looking at the emotional dramatization with the eyes of irony?  Maybe even with humor and an implied wink? Perhaps not the tears, but rather the black eyes of the bride/painter, similar to the darkened eyes of the Middle Eastern girls painted by Gutman and Rubin in the twenties – are the key to the charcoal morbidity of these paintings. \r\nDuring the time spent working on the \"Tunisian Bride\" series, Khen Shish consciously corresponded with the Moroccan bride appearing in Eugene Delacroix's \"Jewish Wedding\", painted in 1839. The Moroccan wedding did in fact take place in the city of Tangier, in Morocco, on the February 21st, 1832, and the Parisian painter, charmed by the veiled East revealed to him, documents in his journal in precise detail the shadows, the whiteness of the sleeves, the darkness of the eyes, the beauty of the bride's face, the purple and gold tones of the fabrics, and finally the sunlight lighting falling on the wall. Not a word about the groom. Same is the case in Breughel's Wedding Party, where the groom is left out of the frame. Only in Rembrandt's \"Jewish Bride\" does the groom appear beside his bride as he gently places his hand on hers… In Kafka's work we find the groom \"standing alone, leaning on the door, looking outside\", while the bride \"stood amidst friends and acquaintances\" at the peak of the engagement celebration held \"on a nice warm evening in the month of June\". Kafka himself, an \"insubordinate groom\", will always find a way out of marital life, will eventually roll into the body of an insect and will play the role of the inner horror of rejection and incompatibility, compensated by the freedom of creation. \r\nDizzied by the whirling sensation of creation, Khen Shish's Tunisian Bride stands tall and beautifully black eyed, as she rises up in her own flames into the space of painting and imagination. A flock of ravens flutters around her, and the groom disappears in a cloud of smoke.",

    "authorDescription": "I Didn't Have the Heart to Wake You\r\nText by Naomi Aviv — 2013\r\n\r\nShe shows up to our meeting with a flower again, offering it with a delicate gesture and a benevolent smile. One flower with a long stem. A Gerbera. Thirteen years ago, when she started exhibiting drawings and collages, she could fill entire walls with basic gestures, with automatic, diligent line drawings, topped by one or several petals. Sometimes that petal became an eye. She made lots of eye-flowers with stems. The same flower, if shown upside down, became a light bulb dangling from a wire, like the lonely light bulbs in the American artist Philip Guston's paintings. At times the light bulb became a black and melancholic sun or a frustrated corm. The bulb would develop into a bird, an insect, a kind of beetle, which would metamorphose in its turn into a kind of spider with multiple arms and tentacles. These graphic motifs, kinds of symbols, seemed to take shape spontaneously. Her papers were pasted directly onto the walls of Hagar Gallery in Jaffa, covering them from top to bottom. Already back then her symbolic scribbles were seen as expressive, essential, temperamental and legitimate expressions. The legitimacy for these ideograms came from precedents such as Raffi Lavie, Aviva Uri and Moshe Gershuni.\r\n\r\nNow, as she unfolds the large canvases – diptychs and triptychs and one pentaptych – measuring in metres and about to be exhibited for the first time at Gordon Gallery, she herself is overtaken. It seems she has completed the transition from drawing to painting. The works, layered with spontaneous touches in a limited palette, have acquired an authoritative air. Painting-painting. An energetic dialectic of covering and erasing; an intimate and free dialogue which seemingly refuses to be locked in a cage of words or of distinct figures; black or golden paint applied directly from the container, by hand and by brush, with a line and with fingertip taps. It was Clement Greenberg who in the 1950s defined such painting as an “event”, training our gazes to follow the traces left by body gestures on the canvas: painting as a collection of testimonies to the painterly act itself, its force or its tenderness, its stutter or its eloquence, its length or its punctiliousness. In the eighties this type of art, which peaked in the fifties, engendered a burst of vibrant neo-expressionist activity, with raw, primitivist forms and emotional, symbolist contents, which looked into the historical and mythical depth and used it as a launch pad to embarkon a fresh painterly adventure. Many artists breathed life into certain aspects of the original abstract expressionism. The neo-expressionist energy came from Europe – Germany, Italy – with mythological artists such as Kiefer and Richter, and the transavantgarde of Clemente, Chia, Cucchi and Paladino, and settled in New York. Israel also saw the development of a strong local-international version of romantic and emotional neo-expressionist painting, for example in the painting of Tsibi Geva. Julian Schnabel, the disputed star of the expressionist return to painting, claimed that the neo-expressionism of the eighties actually emerged in opposition to Greenbergian abstraction. According to him, the new painting offered an “art that was less elitist, less hermetic. Its subject matter was more overtly related to life.” Nonchalant and unpretentious graphic rawness, and a constant movement between the controlled and the uncontrolled received emblematic expression in the art of Jean-Michel Basquiat, which has remained as contemporary as it was at the moment of its birth. “It’s abstract and it’s over the top,” Basquiat summed it up.\r\n\r\nRoberta Smith, the New York Times art critic, recently published a piece in which she tried to delineate the state of contemporary painting. Her principal claim is that painters today are freer in regards to painting than ever before. She suggests that today, the encounter between the representational and the abstract seems vital and natural. Painting in her view is in a moment of dazzling balance between the representational and the abstract. The painters who have emerged in the last decade enjoy artistic freedom. They paint what they want in a wide variety of styles, materials and methods.",

    "authorDescription": "My career in ceramics began almost by coincidence, if such a thing exists. While I was living in France, accompanying my partner during his academic studies, I found a ceramics class in a small village called Montigni sur Loing. The material captivated my attention and I was intrigued by the long process that each piece goes through before the final outcome.\r\nAs I did not want to return to my career as a social worker and was looking for a new profession, I began studying ceramics intensively with various artists. At the same time, upon my return to Israel, I took a ceramics course at the Tel Aviv Museum , purchased basic equipment and began experimenting in a rundown storeroom behind my house. One day the father of my son's friend, impressed by my work, ordered a large quantity for his restaurant and that’s how the story began… \r\nSlowly but surely, I began occupying more space in the garden and transformed the storeroom into a comfortable and spacious studio. In retrospect, a year of studies in the University of Brazil’s Faculty of Art and the general experience I gained, including the ceramics courses, influenced my whole life.\r\nToday I am devoted to my work in the studio and enjoy every moment of creating functional, decorative and artistic pottery.",

    "about": "We are surrounded by our city. Its architecture, that often survived many generations of humans, tells about ever-changing values of a society. The buildings reflect this process and echo history. Edifices decay, become demolished, knocked down or restored. The international artists from different cultural backgrounds participating in the exhibition have visited and captured residential buildings around the world. With their own visual language they explore relations between humans and their self-created surroundings, living conditions, esthetic approaches, personal fate.\r\nIn the space of the exhibition, architectural sites mediated through each artist's personal view, reveal its presence. Distinctions, similarities or correlations of buildings from different parts of the world become sensible. The exhibition offers the viewer to experience his environments embedded in a global cross-cultural context to reveal a new perspective on his own surroundings.\r\nCurated by Tina Sauerländer\r\nTina Sauerländer is an art historian, curator and writer based in Berlin. With peer to space, she curates contemporary art exhibitions for several institutions and galleries, e.g. When the Cat’s Away, Abstraction (2016), Share Your Teeth (With The Ones You Love) (2016), Dark Sides Of… (2015), Across the Lines (2014), Entering Space (2013), Non-Stop Infinity (2011) or Identity Reset?

    "authorDescription": "DIANA ARTUS (*1974, lives and works in Berlin, Germany)\r\nThe German artist Diana Artus explores different aspects of cities around the globe. She uses photography as a basic tool for her sculptures, wall reliefs or cut-outs. The perception of cities and its narratives, the process of memory and the reinterpretation of urban phenomena and architectural bodies – in short: the relationship humans have with their self-created surroundings – are the focal points of her artistic interest. The works she created for the exhibition are all based on photographs the artist took in Seoul, South Korea, last year.\r\nHIROHITO NOMOTO (*1971, lives and works in Hiroshima, Japan)\r\nIn his series Façade, Japanese artist Hirohito Nomoto deals with the disastrous impact of the tsunami that hit Japan in 2011. His photographs of the facades of destroyed buildings are accompanied by personal information about the place: “Akazaki, Ofunato-city, Iwate, Private residence. The ocean is behind the residence. Before the tsunami, a couple and their son lived here.“ The series tells about personal loss and grief. In contrast to manmade conflicts, natural disasters that destroy life of thousands out of the blue, cannot be predicted or prevented\r\nPOLA SIEVERDING (*1981, lives and works in Berlin, Germany)\r\nIn her mixed media installations based on photography and video German artist Pola Sieverding explores the relationship between documentation and staging in visual language. She is interested in the creation of narratives and their depiction of human living conditions. Close To Concrete II shows façades of two large-scale housing estates in Berlin. The close ups reveal the esthetic surface of the concrete and how its usage defines the living space of inhabitants. At the same time Close To Concrete II communicates the change of perception of the large (brutalist) housing estates from a democratic utopia to an anachronistic, brute relic.\r\nELI SINGALOVSKI (*1984, lives and works in Tel Aviv, Israel)\r\nThe works by Israeli artist Eli Singalovski deal with (often residential) architecture mainly in Israel and Europe. He is interested in the phenomena of how residents intervene and alter the architecture of a building they live in. The artist avoids focusing on a specific population or country, but shows that this behavior is all too human and therefore widespread and common in the entire world. The long-exposure nocturnal photography, and the transition to black and white, allow to some extent the isolation of the buildings from their surroundings and a creates a sculpture-like appearance.",

    "about": "Does the sea have a door?, is there a house with no room?, are there \r\nwords without letters?\r\nThese are some of the questions that my son Romy asks me. He has \r\nno idea how much his thinking influences me, a thinking that is not \r\nyet rooted in the limited possibilities that life inflicts on us, even the \r\nmost poetic of us. \r\nLetters without words, yes, of course. Always. James Joyce took the \r\nfurthest right? Finnegans Wake, an unreadable book that has stretched \r\nwords and letters to the fullest. But words without letters? A form \r\nwith no structure? Just the question as a thought is enough for me. \r\nPainting without marks of paint. Food without ingredients. Can this \r\nmagic be made? Is this what Romy means? Is this what he wants to \r\nknow? Can there be something made without the ingredients of that \r\nthing? Is this what our ultimate aim is? Who am I to say? \r\nIs this is what painting now is? It has to be a form with no structure, \r\na word without letters, letters without a word, two new words that \r\nmake a third. The irreconcilable, the holding of opposing poles \r\nsimultaneously. Painting now is free, and maybe in order to resonate \r\nit has dissolve and hide its inner structure in order to regain it.\r\nHere is a show of five painters, who make visible what resists visibility.",

    "about": "\"A way of thinking\" is an extension of the “Universom” exhibition, part of the International Photography Festival being held in the nearby Jaffa Port. It is exhibited at START Gallery, situated by the flea market in Jaffa, and contains 20 works by a dozen Israeli artists drawn exclusively from the START Collection.\r\n\r\nThe exhibition can be imagined as a time-capsule of human material, sent to outer space and discovered by aliens a million years from now. The exhibition embodies the exact moment of revelation, when the aliens understand that the attempt to change planet earth and live within it, has failed. The exhibition deals with this failure both conceptually and philosophically, from a retrospective point of view. It discusses the notion of the artistic medium and act of creation, exposing it to an existential process.  \r\n\r\nThe exhibition takes a temple-like structure, with Shai Id Alony’s totems in particular, embuing it with a holy atmosphere. The exhibition wishes to discuss the concept of holiness on a metaphysical level, reminding us of our religious past and the ancient human necessity in faith, ritual and ceremony. Furthermore, the structure is symmetrical and precise, with an almost obsessive accuracy. This exposes the unnatural human need to construct order around us.\r\nCurator: Sharon Toval",

    "about": "Yasha Cyrinski's extensive solo show includes drawings, print reliefs, and objects from recent years, as well as artworks that were made especially for this exhibition. Cyrinsky was born in 1959 in Paris, graduated from Bezalel in 1984, and was one of the most notable artists in the late 80's. After a period living in the U.S. and Netherlands, Cyrinsky returned to Israel in 1993. \r\n\r\nCyrinski's works deal with the different languages of imitation and mechanical reproduction, yet are made by hand in a precise and tiresome way, creating enigmatic images that the naked eye cannot immediately decipher. The objects and sculpture-like reliefs Cyrinsky creates deal with the legacy of modern art and the aesthetics of the \"machine\" that was orphaned from it. They have an almost space-future-modernistic look about them, and become sorts of 'relics from the future,' as the artist calls them. \r\n\r\nIn the last decade Cyrinski has seldom shown his works in Israel, thus this exhibition provides a much-welcomed opportunity to become re-acquainted with his fascinating oeuvre, as well as discover new works that have yet been exhibited.",

    "about": "For his second solo show at Sommer Contemporary Art, American artist Tom Burr will exhibit new works in his recent series called ‘Grips’. Burr’s diverse practice, which includes sculpture, collage, installations and writing, draws from minimal and conceptual traditions as well as from contemporary architecture.\r\n \r\nThe ‘Grips’ series includes objects made of hot rolled steel. These are sculptural collages, combining the partly oxidized surface with mirror-like polished stainless steel, glass, and images printed on stainless steel panels. These panels, some large, some intimately small, are geometrically punctured, creating empty frames. They will be exhibited along the walls of the gallery, encompassing a central piece made of a large glass panel.  Positioned between the two columns of the gallery, this panel will be gripped by two steel braces.\r\n \r\nThe word ‘grip’, meaning to seize or hold firmly, may also refer to emotional or intellectual grip. A grip can be passionate and loving or violent and suffocating. The word also contains physical and sculptural qualities; it is a meeting point, a place where one form holds or carries the other. A grip is also a device used in filmmaking, and Burr’s Grips indeed bare cinematic qualities: steel plates carrying still images, or ‘frames’. The images, taken by Burr with a simple iPhone camera, create a kind of anecdotal, dismantled urban narrative.\r\n \r\nThis narrative is duplicated in the gallery space itself. The Grips, referring to human dimensions, grip the viewer – they create a reflexive environment, in which, much like our contemporary urban surroundings filled with mirror towers, the viewer is constantly echoed. Burr’s previous works explored the privatization of public spaces and means of surveillance, at a time when the distinction between private and public was still present. The current ‘Grips’ series mirror the collapse of these spaces in a time of self-surveillance and urban isolation, a time when shiny artworks become a Selfie photo-op.",

    "about": "Every moment of our lives we are called on to part from the things we love: \r\n\r\nFrom people, habits, opinions, perspectives, health, beauty and youth, even our own image and \r\n\r\nidentity. Still, parting represents change, and it is tied to a feeling of pain and sorrow that \r\n\r\ndrives us to avoid it at all costs. \r\n\r\nBut is it not this eternal process of separation that allows for all the beauty and love in our life \r\n\r\nto take place? \r\n\r\nA Buddhist parable describes a man who is standing at the edge of a field of flowers at dawn. \r\n\r\nHe looks over this field and sees the flowers opening, the drops of morning dew glimmering on \r\n\r\ntheir petals. He knows that this is so only for an instant, which shortly the drops of dew will slip \r\n\r\ndown onto the earth and evaporate, and the flowers will remain still. From the transience and \r\n\r\nvulnerability of this moment, one can experience all of the beauty of the world together with \r\n\r\nthe innate understanding that everything passes. Even pain, beauty, and inspiration, are all just \r\n\r\nfleeting moments, temporary meetings between the sensory input and conscious thought, the \r\n\r\nbreath and bodily feeling of the man standing at the edge of the field. (Matty Liblich, Between \r\n\r\nPain, Sorrow, and Hardship). \r\n\r\nThis exhibition features works by 17 artists in a variety of mediums. The works are organized in \r\n\r\nthe space chronologically, in accordance to our life cycle from birth to “re-birth”. \r\nThey deal with questions of identity and memory that are brought up when we process and go through intense changes in our lives. One of them, death, is an encounter that accompanies us throughout our lives, not just at their end. But an encounter with death does not necessarily represent the end of life but rather the beginning of a new one. Often we experience separations before we have even begun to comprehend the enormous void they threaten to split open within us. Sometimes years can pass before we realize the effect they have had on us. \r\n17 artists have contributed paintings, drawings, collages, photographs, videos, sound and poetry pieces, and intimate moments from their own lives, to this unique exhibition.\r\n\r\nCurator: Reuma Chayot",

    "about": "Dos” / “Spiritual Abstract”, Shai Azoulay\r\n\r\n“There are three types of Hassidim: the one that wants scraps, the second wants to hear Torah, and the third – whose Rabbi burns in his heart”. (Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, Chayey Moharan) \r\n\r\nThe artist Shai Azoulay commits another component in his spiritual work, and worships his god by the “act” of painting- And an action it is indeed. \r\n\r\n“An artist must make a rock speak”, so he says. \r\nAzoulay commits his singular prayer in his private studio, without a prayer group or any audience, he holds the paint-laden brush and thrusts it at the stretched canvas. He stains it, leading, collecting and folding his outlines within it, as a cantor holding the silver pointer and wandering with it upon the Torah scroll, pointing in revelation and uncovering black ink letters upon the leather surface. \r\n\r\nAzoulay is a representative of the public who aims to document, immortalize and create meeting points of seemingly everyday events amongst the Hasidic community, which lives and functions in a hermetically sealed environment of their own, strangers and strange to the world outside them. In his mission as a “painting laborer” he traces a thin line upon a delicate wall. He is not an anthropologist documenting religious, mystical, and transcendent moments – instead he works through them, simultaneously from the perspective of a believer, a newly orthodox Jew, and from that of a rich painterly tradition of precise, indefatigable work. \r\n\r\n\"The whole of the world is a very narrow bridge”, writes Rabbi Nachman of Breslov. Azoulay is precisely that bridge: in his world order, his actions and his manners there is no separation between the everyday activities of working in the studio, praying communally, attending critique sessions at universities of contemporary art, retreating to a field, laying Tefilin, and presenting artwork at local art spaces. \r\nThe bridge, or fence, as it were, is formed and lives between these two worlds, and is borne and created as though from thin air. \r\nIn Azoulay’s paintings, a simple and colorful documentarization becomes humorist, playful and teasing. The Gemora’s chapter on “Tractate Sotah” poses the question of who is a “Hassid fool”, providing plenty of examples and explanations. \r\nAzoulay does not point a blaming finger, he is devoid of criticism. His Hassidim are often painted as blots, their faces erased and expressionless, with their Shtreimel, capes, coats and white stockings, “unexposed”, the private Hassid as an indefinable identity. A black mark flowing in a colorful field bursting with life. \r\nHis Hassidim carry with them a past, often a heavy burden of religion, order and hierarchy as they sit to the great Rabbi’s Tisch, in his court, as he delivers his shattering weekly sermon. At this obligatory call to arms they bow under the wings of the Holy Presence, awed by the gaping skies that slowly send out gracious threads of light. \r\n\r\nAnd here, in the piece “Poodle”, a stereotypical Jewish Hassid walks in a deserted field, dark and muddy, as dim city lights glow behind him, as though reminding the wanderer of his past as a reference scale, a starting point marking the beginning, middle, and unknown destination. The Hassid is no symbol for the Messiah, he does not ride a white donkey. He is split, cross-bred, multicultural, possibly dragging or being dragged by a live witness in his past, with a poodle accompanying him on his spiritual journey.  \r\n\r\nIf the Hassidim in the series “Dos” are devoid of expressions, of facial features, then in the image “The Seven Openings” the Menorah’s seven stalks are fitted or planted with human-like “eyes”, “ears”, “nostrils” and “mouths”. The formal articulation and presentation of the Menorah aims to ascribe it with a unique sketch of the “facial openings” – a painting intended at morality, as Halakhic instructions for lighting the inner Menorah. \r\nThe Jewish Kabbalah and mysticism are based on the “laws of form equation” – images are attracted to images, events to people, and people are drawn to the realms of the world in which they are manifest. Azoulay opens up yet another “channel” that looks upon the breakage of form, doubling of image, veiling, revealing and unmasking.\r\n\r\nHe will present the second series as a bolster, an addition or the key to a code. Azoulay names it the “Spiritual Abstract”. What is the tie between abstract and spiritual? Everything. The world comes to an end for lack of a common and clear language. The limit of language is the limit of man. And that is where rules and tools will be broken, and the opening to the heavens will take place. Eleven “Abstract spiritual” paintings (oil on paper) comprise the window to Henri Matisse’s legacy, and an option of mysterious ethics, of a subconscious. Azoulay appropriates graphic citations, signal and samples of sign language that deal with the secret of mark and form. \r\nIsrael Kabala",

    "about": "Amir Nave | Introspection\r\nSommer Contemporary Art is pleased to announce the opening of Amir Nave’s solo\r\nshow, which will include large paintings made of oil and graphite on canvas, smaller \r\ndrawings of ink and pen on paper, and a large floor painting. All feature Nave’s \r\ncharacteristic characters, stranded amidst estranged existentialistic scenes. As \r\nopposed to his former, condensed works, in his current paintings it seems that Nave \r\nexperienced a process of reduction and cleansing, so that the materiality of the \r\nempty canvas is more present, and sometimes only minimal lines or contours are \r\nseen, indicating movement. The canvases themselves are stretched on the wooden \r\nframe as if incidentally, and their unravel edges imply a process of decay.\r\nNave continues to challenge the mythical status of painting, as he lays one of his \r\npaintings on the floor, and invites the viewers to step on it. This floor work may be \r\nread as a key to the entire show. It allows the viewer to walk inside a scene, \r\ncharacteristic of Nave’s paintings, or in fact to enter into the artist’s stream of \r\nconsciousness. Doodles and half-sentences, written in the artist’s own handwriting \r\nwith a blue marker, fill the edges of the frame, reminiscent of Nave’s earlier works, in \r\nwhich the text was more present. Here, the writing indicates thought processes. The \r\npieces of paper are attached together haphazardly, with brown Sellotape, as if the \r\ndrawing continuously gone out of control and exceeded its frame.\r\nOften the head in Nave’s works is amputated, painted on a piece of fabric or paper \r\nand attached to the body, as if it was decapitated and now put back in its place. This \r\nseparation allows Nave to play with the position of the head, whether vertical or \r\nhorizontal in relation to the body. In his large paintings, this is a condensed head, \r\npurple and fleshy. It is hanging flimsily, on top of an emptied body, which can barely \r\ncarry it. In the drawings, the body is a bit more present, and the head itself is drawn \r\nas a clear continuation of the body. But the separation between the two is still \r\npresent, in the form of yellow plastic glue stains, anointed on the figures head.\r\n_______________\r\n\r\nIn the S2 project room:\r\n\r\nHonest Disclosure / Itzhak Livneh\r\n\r\nFor is solo show at Sommer Contemporary Art, Yitzhak Livneh will turn the gallery’s \r\nproject room into a showroom, filled with items. Paintings, identical in their square \r\nformats and size, all made in the last two years, cover the walls and compete over \r\nthe viewer attention, as if they were shiny merchandise. Some are made with spray, \r\nsome with oil colours, on white Formica panels. Using graining techniques and \r\nspecial silicon tools, Livneh paints, or better yet creates, wooden textures (‘faux \r\nbois’), and flickering cum-digital patterns. Decorative techniques are used here for \r\nabstract painting. The colours are bright and shiny, and together the works look like a \r\ncatalogue of textures and patterns.\r\nIn some of the paintings, short two to three words sentences appear, all in an \r\nidentical font. Here, the paintings become posters or signs, while the patterns \r\nfunction as backgrounds. The sentences are taken from different fields, some are \r\nproperty selling pitches: ‘a-m-a-z-i-n-g one bedroom apartment’, ‘small quiet street’; \r\nsome are taken from the practice of small businesses and dubious loans: ‘buy today \r\npay tomorrow’, ‘loan for any purpose’, some are Jewish religious slogans: ‘long live \r\nthe Messiah King’, ‘in god we trust’; and some are seductive lines from the sex \r\nindustry: ‘waiting for you’, ‘rooms by the hour’. They all crawl from the tel-avivian \r\nstreet into the white clean gallery, promising and tempting slogans that can be found \r\non stickers, signs, adds and commercials, combined together into a condensed \r\nattack on the viewer.\r\nLike these sentences, some dubious, false or even malicious, and hiding double \r\nmeanings, the formalistic aspect of the works also offers different kinds of illusions, \r\nconcealments and [honest] disclosures. From within this reflexive painterly \r\nabstraction, the concrete filters through. The sentences are taken from the local \r\nstreet and social structure, and together, they imply a certain feeling of urgency or \r\nemergency, and are charges with political implications.",

    "about": "In his new exhibition Hillel Roman is presenting a new body of work consisting of large scale charcoal drawings. The works exhibited – of multi layered natural charcoal – reproduce images from an array of subjects and a variety of resources; among them are images Roman finds in his web escapades. Many of the images Roman chooses echo promises or desires of a better reality; based on order and unity - though in most cases these promises fade and the illusion of order and control collapses, remaining unfulfilled. The drawings describe a 70’s NASA space colony design planned to its last detail, including streets, houses, gardens, and trees that spill out of a huge cornucopia; an old ‘TNUVA’ dairy poster showing a collection of products that appear as an architectural model, a blurry ghost town, after being stripped off of any brand identity; an old science fiction movie scene displaying an end to an old world and a rise of a new, capturing the moment a movie theatre explodes as a result of bombing; snapshot of a porous material as seen through the eyes of an electron microscope appearing simply as a mound of pointy cubes; the Shahadah testimony, as written on the Hamas flag - “there is no god but God, Muhammad is the messenger of God” – expressing the desire for one unifying god. This drawing, seemingly different from the rest, may best portray the undermining of worshiping rational values, but even this ornamental sentence appears as a structure - containing the spiral Arabic letters – as the forming of a new social order. \r\nDespite the distinct figurative nature of Roman’s work it is on the verge of abstract, expressed by omitting details and repeating basic geometric shapes, presuming to reveal a unifying hidden force behind the chaotic multiplicity of phenomena. Yearning for order, uniformity, and unity, is ambivalently present within the works: on the one hand it is a utopian aspiration for a universal equality and on the other an aggressive and violent aesthetical claim.\r\nRoman’s decade-long use of a primitive simple tool such as charcoal enables a realistic glance on the visual and mental foundations on which leans the hellish heaven of the 21st century. The contrasting monochromatic picturesque filter – through which images are run by – produce a ghostly utopian narrative that bounces off the paper in its gloomy light of unrealized promises. \r\nCurator: Ravit Harari\r\n***\r\nThe artist book UNIVERSAL, launched with the exhibition, includes a comprehensive selection of Roman's works from recent years, as well as documentation of objects and large installation, and an essay by poet Merchav Yeshurun, discussing the redemptive space in which the artist works. The book is published by STERNTHAL BOOKS and with the support of Mifal HaPais Council for the Culture and Arts.",

    "authorDescription": "Michal Lewit > Black Box / Curator: Tali Tamir\r\n\r\nLewit investigates the physical household in relationship to the family members who inhabit \r\n\r\nit, and the transience of their own presence inside it.  In her painting, the houses are built like \r\n\r\na Lewit-Richter architectural model, a box which emphasized its own horizontality and \r\n\r\nplanes of depth that intersect each other in the space. The three dimensional sketch \r\n\r\npreserves a sort of “spacial genetics”, and the visual sensitivity of someone who grew up in a \r\n\r\nfamily or renown architects (her father is Yaakov Richter and grandfather Zeev Richter), and \r\n\r\nwho, from a young age, was exposed to the idea that space, angles, and axes are important \r\n\r\nsubjects of thought and contemplation. \r\n\r\nZehava Edelsburg > I Lined Up / Curator: Arie Berkowitz\r\n\r\nThe sculptural objects that Zehava creates are built of many physical and metaphysical \r\n\r\nlayers. Eldersburg examines creative processes and imagery, taking them of of their original \r\n\r\ncontext and imbuing them with new meanings through the testimony of material memory. \r\n\r\nThis act enhances the materials with spiritual power, and the connections she creates are \r\n\r\nsensitive and poetic. Her method is through trial and error, and her studio is like a lab where \r\n\r\nthe artist acts as a researcher trying to understand the breakdown of materials, their \r\n\r\nrelationships to one another, and their morphology and history. Embodied in these trials is \r\n\r\nan attempt to fix what is broken and give it new meaning. In order to fix you first have to ruin. \r\n\r\nThe taking apart and putting together don't erase the origins of these materials, but rather \r\n\r\ngift them with a philosophical and psychological renewal.\r\n\r\nOrit Goldman > Angels Falling from the Sky / Curator :Arie Berkowitz\r\n\r\nOrit Goldman describes her paintings using spiritual and mythological terms, and draws out \r\n\r\na critical approach to the concept of beauty. Her series Falling Angels is a tribute to Wim \r\n\r\nWenders’ movie Wings of Desire. Goldman treats the act of falling as both a physical and \r\n\r\nmetaphysical state. This movement of falling provides the central theme in these works, \r\n\r\nwhich can be found in dresses expanding as they twirl for a final bow, as well as in the angel \r\n\r\nwings that break the fall with whimsical softness in their confrontation with a concrete earth. \r\n\r\nThe works are large-scale paintings, made in a mixed media technique that involves lots of \r\n\r\nwide brushstrokes in bright colors and moments of transparency and collage, that upon \r\n\r\ncloser inspection unravel their figurative imagery.",

    "about": "Does the sea have a door?, is there a house with no room?, are there \r\nwords without letters?\r\nThese are some of the questions that my son Romy asks me.

Always. James Joyce took the \r\nfurthest right? Finnegans Wake, an unreadable book that has stretched \r\nwords and letters to the fullest. But words without letters? A form \r\nwith no structure? Just the question as a thought is enough for me. \r\nPainting without marks of paint. Food without ingredients. Can this \r\nmagic be made? Is this what Romy means? Is this what he wants to \r\nknow? Can there be something made without the ingredients of that \r\nthing? Is this what our ultimate aim is? Who am I to say? \r\nIs this is what painting now is? It has to be a form with no structure, \r\na word without letters, letters without a word, two new words that \r\nmake a third. The irreconcilable, the holding of opposing poles \r\nsimultaneously.

    "about": "The CCA is pleased to present Sound Requires a Medium, Maya Dunietz’s first solo, large-scale, site-specific, sound art exhibition. Dunietz is a composer, musician, and sound artist based in Israel whose work ranges from composing for ensembles and choirs, performing as a pianist and singer, and creating sound installations. She founded the Givol Choir, an experimental vocal ensemble and is a member of the band “Habiluim.” Her work has been presented at venues including the Palais de Tokyo, Paris (2014), Arnolfini, UK (2013), and the Swiss Pavilion at the Venice Biennale (2011). Dunietz has recently been awarded the Prime Minister’s Prize for Composers.\r\n\r\nDunietz works at the intersection of visual art, music, sound, and performance. In all of these mediums, her practice is abstract and experimental, intent on shifting viewers’ and listeners’ attention to the essence of perception. Dunietz is inspired by sound theorists, scientists and philosophers, such as Lord Kelvin and his exploration of sound, matter and space, and Pauline Oliveros who coined the term and practice of “Deep Listening” that aims to connect individuals to their environments and open us up to one another.\r\n\r\nSound Requires a Medium centers on a room-wide installation comprising 10,000 intertwined earbuds. Visitors walk through the labyrinthine structure to take in the dynamic sounds emanating from the earbuds that come together to create a rich and blossoming soundscape, physically pulsating from the sheer quantity of musical sources. The exhibition also includes a series of musical objects made of unexpected materials such as a mechanical bird whistle, a “talking” wall, a sound work heard through one’s teeth when biting a straw, and a shaking piano.\r\n\r\nThe specially crafted pieces and the large installation are experiential and interactive, with music composed specifically for them and their architectural surroundings. Each work activates the viewer in different ways – from biting a metal rod, to pressing one’s body against a sonic wall, to caressing a shaking piano, and to the impromptu “dance” that is performed by each viewer as he or she navigates the large earbud installation.\r\n\r\nThe physical engagement with Dunietz’s work is a direct extension of her experimental practice as a composer who constantly stretches the boundaries of the medium, seeking to explore the human capacity to consume and produce sound in infinitely myriad ways. Inspired by pioneering musicians and sound artists ranging back to John Cage and La Monte Young, Dunietz also traces her artistic heritage to the Dada movement through her reliance on improvisation and interdisciplinary methodologies. She works with sound as a plastic medium and considers music within a material world. The result is a captivating project that “resets” the ways in which viewers and listeners perceive their surroundings.",

    "about": "The art world tends to deride, dismiss and declare the end of the realistic movement with claims of repetitiveness, superficiality and lack of sophistication. But lo and behold, not only does the realistic movement not become obsolete; it keeps getting stronger and attracting new viewers, scholars and collectors.\r\nIn my view, the claim about realism’s superficiality and lack of sophistication is itself superficial and unsophisticated. Realistic art embodies no less important social, political and public messages than any contemporary art trend, but in a more subtle and implicit way. At times it is the artist’s masterly execution (and indeed, unlike other artistic trends, realism largely relies on expertise and artistry acquired during long years of study) that diverts our attention from the embedded messages and makes them hard to decipher; at others it is the work’s visual beauty that obscures its implicit statement.\r\nAs for the claim of repetitiveness, Nipo’s landscapes are not the landscapes of Caspar David Friedrich. Eran Webber’s sculptures carry different messages than Renaissance bronze sculptures. Every art reflects the zeitgeist of its period, and therefore cannot be repetitive, even if, as in the case of realism, it draws on ancient traditions.\r\nRealism is not a return backwards, but an eternal return to a movement, a line, a brushstroke – the study of an ancient skill in order to express contemporary conceptions.\r\n \r\nDavid Nipo’s realistic painting, familiar to us from his wonderful, meticulous oil paintings with their perfect compositions and Rembrandtian black light, returns in this exhibition in a different medium – pastels. Painting in pastel is a relatively new medium for Nipo (I can recall only two or three pastel works in the past), in which he has acquired breathtaking skill in a surprisingly short time.\r\n \r\nFrom my profound and longstanding acquaintance with Nipo’s body of work, I can testify that his oil paintings are the result of thorough research and extraordinary intellectualism, which along with a painterly expertise of exquisite quality produce cerebral and uncompromising works, which some feel to be “difficult”. This is mainly evident in his portraits, in which his intellectual integrity makes no allowances, either to himself or to the model, and he remains faithful to himself even if the result is not easy to take in, as for example in Yona Fischer’s portrait from 2013.\r\n\r\n \r\nIn this exhibition, in a new medium for Nipo, we are introduced for the first time to an aspect not previously encountered in his work – the emotional aspect.\r\nIn contrast to the cerebral precision so painstakingly present in the oil works, in the pastel paintings we find tenderness, lightness and unapologetic beauty. Even if the subjects do not change, staying within the same realms (landscapes, portraits or still life), their treatment is infused with emotion, innocence and a new vitality. Or perhaps it is the material softness of the pastels that has brought another thematic novelty to the exhibition: flowers. Brightly-colored buttercups in a glass, elegant daffodils in a long-necked vase and yellow shrubs of wild mustard blossom vibrate with vitality.\r\n \r\nThis becomes evident when we compare the oil painting “My Land Awakens, Good Morning Earth” (2011)\r\n \r\nwith the oval pastel “Fields in the Rain, Western Negev” (2016) from the present exhibition.\r\nThe fields are the same, but the gaze and the feel are completely different. In contrast to the meticulous and rigorous composition of the scorched fields, the multicolored containers, the barrel and the irrigation line in the oil painting, suggesting life and agricultural activity, the field in the pastel painting is depicted in dark, greyish hues, devoid of any human signs and set in an oval frame, as if imprisoned in a bubble of urbanization that gradually encroaches on it from all sides, painting it with the colours of concrete and cement.\r\n \r\nNipo lives in Nir Akiva, a community in the northern Negev, and often paints in the fields surrounding his home. Nipo is a nature person, and this is clearly evident in his landscape paintings. The landscapes in this exhibition – from the eucalyptuses through the oval “Fields in the Rain” to the wild mustard blossoms – turn a lingering, considered gaze on ordinary, everyday pieces of landscape which we tend to pass by without giving them another thought. In Nipo’s work, however, the eucalyptuses teem with an ungraspable wealth of green shades.  Each and every leaf in this large-scale masterpiece receives its own separate treatment, its own shade, form and movement. The fields gleam in bright green speckled with golden glimmers under overcast winter skies, and the three paintings depicting the blossom of the wild mustard – usually a noxious weed that farmers tend to remove – convey the sheer beauty of tender yellow flowers growing out of the hard and dry late-summer soil. And as in all of Nipo’s landscape paintings, be they in oil or in pastel, his reflection of the Israeli light, his precise sense of the season, is incomparable.\r\n \r\nSpeaking of sheer beauty, in this exhibition Nipo paints for the first time flowers as still life. Young buttercups, in pastel colors and in a simple glass, are placed in the center against a light empty background. Ripe buttercups, in stronger colors, on the verge of wilting, in an empty pickles or jam jar. A pair of white daffodils, in an almost invisible glass vase, stand on a shiny white surface.  When I asked Nipo: “Flowers? Why flowers?” he replied simply: “Because I felt like it!”\r\nIn a world that is gradually being covered over with concrete, glass and cement, the distilled beauty of Nipo’s flower paintings is defiant. The simplicity of the composition is unapologetic. And the heart cannot help but expand.\r\n \r\nThe soft materiality of the pastels usually dictates qualities of smearing, blending and blurring, but Nipo’s characteristic precision is unyielding, and he returns to the complex and painstaking compositions in the still life paintings “Tangerines” and “Oranges”. Each material here is distinct: the lumpiness of the peel. The roughness of the plastered wall. The softness of the folds of the light-colored rag, daubed with greenish paint. The dim shine of the china plate against the metal shine of the cup. The faithful reflections on the white surface. And in the background, the Rembrandtian black cloth, the light falling on which constitutes one of the trademarks of Nipo’s painting’s qualities.\r\n \r\nThe women’s portraits are a lesson in restraint; in the essential versus the secondary.\r\nNipo’s self-portraits over the years may serve as a subject for a yet-to-be-written doctoral thesis. The recent three, featured in this exhibition, cannot be fully read in isolation from all the previous ones, but like their predecessors they too raise questions of self-perception, identity and masculinity – questions which shall remain open for the viewer.\r\n \r\n \r\nThe young and talented sculptor Eran Webber, born in 1980, studied at the Florence Academy of Art (FAA) and the Accademia di Belle Arte in Florence, graduating with distinction and going on to teach at the FAA. Webber participated in many exhibitions in Europe and the United States. This is his first exhibition in Israel.\r\n \r\nWebber’s sculptures meld the live model with the artist’s narrative. The one does not exist without the other. According to Webber, he feels obliged “to permeate under the model’s skin, in both the physical and the psychic sense”, in order to get to the source of the form and the force that drives him or her; the narrative he attaches to his works engages with the complexity of life, with difficulties, self-destruction, the passing of time and the betrayal of the body.\r\n \r\nThe older woman in the sculpture “Royalty” carries the world’s sorrow on her hunched shoulders. The work is also called “Joba”, since into the bronze is cast a long chapter of grief and pain in the model’s personal life, which she personifies along with the personification of universal sorrow implicit in the work. The crown on her head, more reminiscent of Christ’s crown of thorns than a magnificent royal crown, is crooked and seems to burden her. Her face is tormented and her nudity is the aging nudity of us all.\r\n \r\nThe sculpture “Samson’s Choice” deals with the self-destruction inherent in many of us, and in Israel as a nation.  When the biblical Samson realizes that his death is near, he asks God for strength to commit one last act, deadly to his enemies as to himself, in order to annihilate as many Philistines as possible. “Samson’s Choice” is the balance of terror between nations that possess nuclear weapons. From the biblical perspective Samson’s act is perceived as heroic, but one cannot ignore the element of self-destruction inherent in anyone who chooses to perform such an act. The moment the decision is taken to perform an act of this kind is a moment of metaphorical blindness – blindness as opposed to the ability to see beyond that moment; therefore there is no difference between Samson, who loses his sight, and those who are able to see but cannot use their eyes, and this is one of the reasons for the cover on the figure’s eyes. Its posture is equally unheroic. This is not “Samson the hero”, but a figure dancing between destruction and sanity.\r\n \r\nThe sculpture “Synopsis” was created over six months, and offers a reflection on the slow, careful and calculated pace required by the artist who sculpts in bronze – an incomparably complex and long process – in contrast to the crazed and chaotic rhythm of contemporary life. In the age of “synopsis” – precis, summary – in which we only read the headline, look at the picture, text instead of talking and all the other things we cram in in order to gain more time in which to cram in more things – “Synopsis” is everything but a summary. It is the depth that exists in everything, but must be approached, deciphered. It leaves the world outside and shuts its eyes to what is going on; living in its own world, like a bronze sculpture, it is neither dependent on nor influenced by time.\r\n \r\nThe sculpture “Androgyna” engages with movement and sexual identity and tells the story of the artist’s rapport with a beautiful and athletic model, and the personal boundaries he sets himself in depicting her. The artist’s loaded and ambiguous relationship with the model is passed on to the viewer. The figure draws on Michelangelo’s women sculptures, which were “superimposed” on an originally masculine body. The body’s posture is dynamic, and from where she stands in relation to the viewer one might think she is a man, with her broad shoulders, short hair and sharp facial features. Only a look from a different angel reveals her breasts and makes us rethink our perception of what is “masculine” or “feminine”. Her posture creates tension and interest, encouraging a circumferential gaze that reveals how different she is from each angle and point of view.\r\n \r\n“Solomon” is based on the figure of Nico, an older man whom Webber met at a Florentine café during his studies. Webber asked him to sit for him, but Nico was skeptical and only consented after visiting the studio. Even then he refused to set a date for the sitting, suddenly appearing, a month later, at the studio’s door.\r\nDuring the work, which was slow and intermittent – for Nico only agreed to sit once a week, either on Saturday or Sunday, and only between 11am and 1pm, since he preferred to spend half the day sleeping and the other gazing and thinking – Nico turned out to be a fascinating character, knowledgeable and full of stories, until Webber found himself abandoning his original narrative for the project and concentrating on Nico’s face, movements and voice.\r\nThe relationship between sculptor and model turned into a relationship between a young and fascinated student and a revered teacher-philosopher, and once Webber discovered that Nico was also a very popular figure around Florence, he chose to call the sculpture “Solomon” – after King Solomon, the wisest man, because although King David is the symbol of Florence, Webber saw Nico – “Solomon” – as the city’s real king.\r\nThe sculpture, a bust in the classical Roman style, looks like an archeological finding. In an age that strives forward in a feverish pace, in which forty- and fifty-year olds are already pushed to the margins as irrelevant, it is never redundant to look back and honor the wisdom of the ancients, the cradle of Western culture.\r\nAn Eternal return.\r\n \r\nDr. Ronnie Fuhrer\r\nApril 2016",

    "about": "In his new exhibition, Chambers is presenting a series of large scale floral paintings.  These paintings are distinguished by vibrancy and saturation of color, emphasized by an unusual materialism. Although the color blocking and general shapes add up to a recognizable figurative image of flowers, the paintings cannot be described as “still lifes\" or \"color field paintings\".   \r\n \r\nAt the core of Chambers' practice is the process itself, the act of 'art-making', rather than the finished 'artistic product'. His work is characterized by a unified size canvas rather than content or style, allowing the spectator to make comparisons between the pieces, series, years, and decisions made.  \r\n \r\nWith the works presented, Chambers further democratizes his art-production: each step is given equal voice. The compositions are drawn and redrawn without color, the acrylic under-paintings exclusively tackle the weight and volume of the composed shapes, and the final surface is exclusively concerned with color. This last stage is created by choosing one color at a time – a choice dictated not by the composition or under-painting but by the pedestrian concern of what color Chambers is interested in that day.  The application, as the material dictates, involves painting an adhesive, then spraying it with color-matched nylon fibers that stick to it. Once dried, a process that takes 24 hours, the excess fibers are removed and the next color is decided on and applied. This allows Chambers to focus on a single color and its concerns, rather than the pictorial success or failure of that color within the composition. In doing so, Chambers challenges the god-like rank the artist has in creating and giving birth to an art piece, as well as the notion that a viewer’s experience is determined by how well he or she understands the artist’s intentions. The final objects stand free of the implications of production and the artist’s hand.",

    "about": "Cao Fei is one China’s most prominent contemporary artists and her work explores the country’s rapid transformation following the Cultural Revolution and the effects of foreign influence throughout its recent development. Her phenomenal video, Haze and Fog, (2013, 46 min.), is a new type of zombie movie set in modern China. Contrary to the tropes of violence, shock, and suspense in horror movies as we know them, Haze and Fog focuses on people up close, slowly, and in detail. It examines the phenomenon of “internal migration” in contemporary China through a series of short scenes that come together to form one coherent story. What at first seems to be a critical glance at modernized Chinese culture via nostalgia for ancient wisdom is actually the complex use of characters who question our understanding of right and wrong, progress and tradition.\r\nIn Haze and Fog, Cao Fei probes her personal and cultural relationship to metropolitan China. Rather than positioning activity as good vs evil, Cao Fei’s major new video explores how the collective consciousness of people living in the time of what the artist calls “magical metropolises” emerges from seemingly tedious, mundane, day-to-day life. This magic reality is created through a struggle at the tipping point between the visible and the invisible.\r\nCao Fei's exhibition at CCA is supported with the assistance of the Ostrovsky Family Fund.\r\nCurator: Sergio Edelsztein",

Her work shows that representative painting can still be relevant, alive and kicking today. Teharlev’s exhibition presents at first, painting at its best: an ambitious, strong and cheeky with amplitude painting, which demonstrates a rare hand skills and technical virtuosity.\r\n\r\nIn this exhibition Taharlev focuses on women.  Women, however, which are not objectified by the male perspective as it has shaped the western painting throughout the ages. The female figures are powerful and do not try to ingratiate themselves:  they wear their internal feelings outwardly, while sitting or standing into themselves and from themselves. Each one of their frozen-in-time bodies is half sitting half sinking and doesn’t face us. Taharlev takes us into the feminine selfhood which essentially is the void that does not belong to sex, gender or sexuality. \r\n\r\nThrough her strong characters, Tharlev deals with fundamental questions in contemporary art and art in general. Her works corresponds with various periods of the history of painting, from Egypt and Rome through the Renaissance until today, and conducts a dialogue with time: with a picturesque representation of space in various times, with the relevance of feminine and virginal nudity as an autonomous language, with the interfaces between observation and imagination and with the various ways in which eternity is created from time itself in different cultural contexts throughout the history.\r\n________________________\r\n\r\nThe Aristocrat / Eitan Buganim\r\n\r\nIn his new exhibition, “The Aristocrat”, Eitan Buganim presents a series of drawings, ten portraits of women looking straight forward (at the viewer/camera).\r\n\r\n“The Aristocrat” insists on ignoring the photographic origin of the series – an online archive of photography from the end of the 19th century to mid-20th century – and refuses to investigate the photographed/painted women’s identity; their names and life circumstances etc. “The Aristocrat” aims to leave them anonymous, in order to focus on their beauty rather than their backgrounds, on the surface and its power of seduction rather than the subject or context.\r\n\r\nIn this series of drawings, most of the figures wear shiny jewelry or fancy attires, and all but one, are cut, wounded, disrupted. “The cutting is another act of appropriation, the marking of territory, especially when the cuts are quite aggressive, sharp, wounding, and at times decapitating, a bit like a picture of an old love, shredded to pieces in a moment of rage, which is now too late to fix…. Alternatively, I feel that the cutting makes the drawing lighter, weightless, vulnerable, like kites in the hands of capricious wind.” writes the artist.",

    "name": "S2 Project Room: Anna K.E. -  Intangible Economies of Desires",
    "about": "In her first show at Sommer Contemporary Art, Anna K.E. created a site-specific installation for the Project Room S2. It creates a hyper environment, where low and high-tech interact and the tactile and virtual merge.\r\n The installation centers around two black metal constructions, carrying monitors with two short videos. K.E., who was trained as a classical dancer, is known for her short videos in which she is performing absurd, abject or Sisyphean actions in her studio, while demystifying the auratic glow of artistic creation. This time, she has taken it out to the street, and is seen from her back, marching or dancing. Another video juxtaposes formal and conceptual coincidental crossroads. Together with a jeans jacket and a pair of sneakers, these random personal attributes grant the space an air of a private living environment.\r\n A linoleum floor piece dictates the installation’s rhythm – it is divided into a grid-like structure, mimicking tiles, which, together with many other references to modernist architecture, are a repeated motif in K.E.’s practice. The grid layout’s repetition is broken with abstract organic shapes, carved into the linoleum to expose underlying colors, along side numbers, which suggest a hidden choreography for the spectator in space.\r\n With symbolic gestures, sensitive aesthetics, a sense of humor and a pretentious title, “Intangible Economies of Desires” creates a small enclave filled with dissipated representations of our spatial-digital habitats.",

Through video, photography, sound and installation, Schnadower examines the role exchange that occurred in the art arena, when artists realized that the best way to make the Critic see them is to respond to her contents, to be present in her feed and in other words: to see her.",

    "about": "Swinging Utopia, by Hendrik Lakeberg\r\n\r\nArchitecture is more than the practical aspiration of man to get a roof over his head; it has an extremely important task: to think about how we can live better. In other words, architecture is inherently utopian.\r\nMadeleine Boschan’s latest works subtly deal precisely with these utopian claims. Her seemingly architectural sculptures create a space that is in a manner both conscious and elegant, and deeply rooted in the history of Western civilisation, giving wings to thoughts, and perhaps even to the body that moves around them.",

    "about": "Under the Skin, Miri Mor’s solo exhibition at Indie Gallery, includes a number of photographic works and a video work that were taken over the past two years. Romania, the location of Mor’s works, is a space in which past and present, tradition and capitalism, exist side by side. In her works Mor challenges familiar cultural contexts and confronts the eternal landscapes of Romania, its rural dwellers, which seem to have been taken from touristy picture postcards with the sights of abandoned factories and nameless workers.\r\nIn these works Mor continues her engagement with examining ways of representing the shaping of collective memory. By adopting visual research strategies stripped of nostalgia Mor poses questions on human existence while engaging with the time dimension. The experience of death and negating the past are the leitmotif, of the works, either metaphorically or concretely, either in the image of a carcass or by presentation of objects from a period long past.\r\n\r\nCurator : Sally Haftel Naveh.",

    "about": "Hana Jaeger is showing 12 large paintings (around 160/180 cm each), painted with Oil, Acrylic and Graphite on Canvas.\r\nJaeger is painting different figures, strangers to themselves as well as their surroundings. She is painting them with no private characterization. Sometimes from their back, on their uniforms, at their work areas which described with minimal characterization – such as garbage can, and Surgical uniforms and masks. Even when their looks directed forward their faces are usually erased, with minimal details, as the brush strokes goes through, ignoring the face contours.\r\nThe surrounding as well is being “built” with monochromatic color - uniform spaces, gloomy and uncharacterized. Sometimes the figures appear inside a leaving room, but still they seems lost, to themselves and to the figure who stands beside them.\r\n* During this exhibition the gallery will be open as well on Saturdays between     \r\n11:00-14:00, In the presence of the artist.\r\nGallery Talk will take place at Friday - 11/3/16 at 12:00 PM",
    "authorDescription": "My painterly world calls for consideration of the peeping experience of painting. The intimacy revealed by peeping at the private situation proves to be an impossible unfocussed contemplation, like being imprisoned within the delineating lines of fantasy.\r\nRefusing to toe the line it engenders disarray. Concurrently treacherous and faithful, abiding by and transgressing the law it remains uncommitted to both looking and depicting and, drifting between the particular and the collective, is annoying.\r\nThe works frontally face the backs of the subjects of the painting, without exchanging looks, possibly not returning a look. The forbidden look creates a disproportionate world echoing questions concerning integrity with regard to the ownership of the look as well as the significance, as a part of the status struggle, of the signs and the signers.\r\nPainting suggests the intransigence of disorder, the fluidity of the sign. It observes the basis of the experience in order to make its aberrations resound.",

    "about": "Does the sea have a door?, is there a house with no room?, are there \r\nwords without letters?\r\nThese are some of the questions that my son Romy asks me. He has \r\nno idea how much his thinking influences me, a thinking that is not \r\nyet rooted in the limited possibilities that life inflicts on us, even the \r\nmost poetic of us. \r\nLetters without words, yes, of course. Always. James Joyce took the \r\nfurthest right? Finnegans Wake, an unreadable book that has stretched \r\nwords and letters to the fullest. But words without letters? A form \r\nwith no structure? Just the question as a thought is enough for me. \r\nPainting without marks of paint. Food without ingredients. Can this \r\nmagic be made? Is this what Romy means? Is this what he wants to \r\nknow? Can there be something made without the ingredients of that \r\nthing? Is this what our ultimate aim is? Who am I to say? \r\nIs this is what painting now is? It has to be a form with no structure, \r\na word without letters, letters without a word, two new words that \r\nmake a third. The irreconcilable, the holding of opposing poles \r\nsimultaneously. Painting now is free, and maybe in order to resonate \r\nit has dissolve and hide its inner structure in order to regain it.\r\nHere is a show of five painters, who make visible what resists visibility.",

    "about": "Erez Aharon shows images of flora , interwoven with a thread (literally), which charges them  with personal, cultural and political cortexes. The starting point is drawing from observation, but the images also tell other stories, for example:  a quiet  restraint mirroring, painful and honest, of the war that we live within Israel today; Internal strife, the values of human and women dignity. Rachel Peretz has written on the works presented:  \"Almost every painting in this series holds at its back a whole complex text, literary and styled, symbolically demanding, and the viewer is invited to decide whom to oblige to – the subtle mute forms, or the heavy smart burden of the meaning, implicit in their names.\"\r\n\r\nGallery talk: Friday, May 6th at 12:00 pm",

    "about": "In her new solo exhibition, Yaara Zach continues to develop the sculptural environments characterizing her work. Her sculpture is based on readymade objects and industrial materials that go through processes of de- and re-assembly, as a result of which they are stripped from their original contexts and charged with new qualities and meanings. This is Zach's second solo exhibition at RawArt Gallery.\r\nRed, blue and yellow unpicked punching bags are spread out on the gallery floor, becoming Dancers endowed with metal chains. Alongside them are carpets made out of dark fake-leather belts that are woven in warp and weft. In this exhibition, Zach radicalized the relationship between beauty and violence found in the works, the sexual and gender meanings they hold, as well as the relations they form with the spectator's body. As the exhibition title implies, Zach converts the gallery into a boxing arena, or a crime scene, where things happen in broad daylight, above the surface. One cannot easily differentiate form from content when observing these works. Despite the strong presence of formal elements such as repetition and craft, interpretations that categorize the works as manifesting aesthetics of casualness or endlessness soon turn out to be insufficient. Instead of easily falling into these categories, or into any type of visual or conceptual pleasure, Zach's works insist on bringing forth the meanings and ramifications of witnessing concrete and palpable fallen material\r\nCurator: Leah Abir\r\nGallery Talk with the artist and curator will take place on Saturday -2/4/16 at 12:00 pm",

    "about": "The caterpillar deceases to allow the butterfly to be born.\r\nAnd yet, the caterpillar still lives inside the butterfly.\r\nTherefore, when I die, what will I become?\r\n\r\nIn many cultures, butterflies represent death as well as rebirth, and some of them believe that butterflies are in fact souls of those who passed away.\r\nMany enchantments and legends were embroidered with this colorful and symmetrical creature called the butterfly and its dark furry cousin, the moth; \r\nWhether as a symbol of the gods such as the Egyptian sun god- Ra and the Greek goddess of soul- Psych, or as a symbol of resurrection in Christianity-  a butterfly in the hands of Jesus in the resurrection of the dead.\r\nWhether as the ‘Bearer of Love’ as it is believed in Mexico and was believed in ancient Maya or as the ‘Bringer of light’ as it is believed in Asia to this day. \r\nThe series “The Silence of the Butterfly” started as a research on symmetry facing asymmetry three years ago (2013), and evolved to the fascinating metamorphosis world of the butterfly that throughout history and numerous cultures symbolized the human being.\r\nIt is impossible not to wonder how this fragile creature manages to survive and live out its metamorphosis processes all in one month from caterpillar to cocoon,  and finally to a butterfly.\r\nAre butterflies aware of the processes that lead to their three-stage development?\r\nDo the metamorphosis phases accompany them with a sense of loss and pain or with a sense of renewal and creation? \r\nCan we, humans, who compares ourselves to the butterfly, survive such radical changes within our lives?\r\nYoni Danziger",

    "about": "Ruven Kuperman's solo exhibition is composed of paintings on paper and wood, which are based on various visual references. They are gathered together to form an over-whole vision, both violent and complex. The starting points for these paintings range from Danzig Baldaev's visual-anthropological research (\"Russian Criminal Tattoo Encyclopedia\", 2003) to anatomical renderings of internal body parts, terrifying iconic portraits, and Japanese prints such as historical \r\nUkiyo-e prints and ones identified with Manga culture.\r\nThis diverse imagery inhabits the basic layers of Kuperman's paintings, providing them not only with compositions and scenographies, but also with ideas and meanings from non-Western worlds. Bringing together seemingly different paintings, this exhibition juxtaposes various cultural signifiers embedded directly on the human body. These imprinted signifiers turn out to be palmistrical lines of fate – codes that denote and position an individual's body within different social systems and hierarchies.\r\nKuperman's paintings displayed in this exhibition produce an inward and outward motion between body and mind. The tattoos scorched on a person's body in one painting become the main subject matter of another painting, and go as far as invading the actual gallery wall. Kuperman's painting is a product of an unrealistically piercing gaze onto a body that is both a skin (tattooed, scarred, smooth, wrinkled) and a sizzling arena of blood vessels and muscle. In this sense, these paintings depict life, consciousness, movement, and pain. Не Буди, read one of the painted man's eyelashes: an untranslatable expression, roughly meaning \"Don't wake (me) up.\"\r\nCurator: Leah Abir\r\nGallery talk with the artist and the curator-  Saturday, May 28, 12:00",
    "authorDescription": "Ruven Kuperman (b. 1964 in Kishinev) lives and works in Tel Aviv.

    "about": "Curator: Carmit Blumensohn\r\nThe exhibition Re-Seek proposes a broad perspective on the concept of \"seeking\", beyond the immediate meaning. The artists in the exhibition approach the subject via diverse perspectives ranging from local and global, tradition and new age, loss and search, destruction and creation. The search is not narrative based. Rather, it proposes entry into a non-verbal field of artistic exploration in multiple media. It oscillates from dramatically sentimental and powerful to \"polite\", didactic and gentle. From works abouthuman identity and the complex architecture of the human soul, to works that place man in the center as a complex being filled with contradictions. The search is authentic, stemming from an awakening and awareness to the act of searching, a search driven by a passionate urge to find a way.",

    "about": "\"Chaos is not the point of departure for creation; it is not the beginning from which the work of art wishes to evolve. Neither is it the end point, to which it aspires. Rather, it is the force present in every phase of its being, at every turn, in the form's interior space, in the interstice between the gaze and its object, in the material. Otherwise there is nothing new, and the new is what interests me. In other words, I am fascinated by the ability to force something to discover the new within itself.\r\nEvery Jan Rauchwerger exhibition raises the question of demarcation, delimiting, cutting out, as well as the question of continuity. These questions seem to draw one another out. One is related to a quasi arbitrary decision, to exhibit the works which bear the signature of the years 2015–2016 as an organizing frame. The other is rife with significant implications: what kind of an exchange occurs with previous exhibitions, with a life lived, with the artist's involuntary memory, the experience reincarnated through the tensing of the muscles, the passion of restart which prevents experience from bursting out….\"  \r\n (Text by Shimon Adaf)\r\n\r\nGallery Talk: Friday, April 15th, 2016 at 12:00 PM",

    "about": "Curator: Hadas Kedar\r\nThe impression that human closeness may be a cure for urban alienation serves as the basis of the exhibition “Night Birds”. Carmi’s photographs focus on his city surroundings at night and construct frames of fictitious realism. His photographs do not document facts but rather combine moments, characters and places - that weren't necessarily at the same time or the same place. Carmi’s body of work was inspired by the American painter Edward Hopper (1882 - 1967) that dealt with the ‘new city’ and its sense of of isolation.\r\nIn affinity to Hopper’s paintings, Carm’s photographs express cinematic periodic-local moments. What may seem in first glance as sights of a sleepy city at night, turn out to be a series of shady nocturnal scenes. Beams of light that puncture the dark reveal random characters enclosed in their solitude.\r\nCarmi’s photographs demonstrate what many of us know - proximity, whether physical or virtual is not necessarily a formula for intimacy.\r\n\r\nGallery Talk will take place on Friday - 27/5/16",

    "about": "“Pinpoint” is a joint exhibit by artists Hilla Ben Ari and Sheffy Bleier in which a series of photography, video and installation works is presented. The show’s works deal with the tension between private and public, with the friction between personal space and social discipline and order.\r\nThrough use of different bodily images, Ben Ari and Bleier suggest a different viewpoint, by which they break down the concept of ‘body’ into its components and enable its reassembly. This process is the means and essence of reweaving the concepts of femininity and masculinity, through which a perception of heterogeneity is enabled.  This contrasts with a single, specific unequivocal point of view, which the show’s title “Pinpoint” refers to ironically. The show attempts to offer a possibility by which the core discussion is deflected from the possessor of power toward the one at which that power is aimed, women or the Other. This action enables observation not only as internalization or as opposition, but also as a creative form of an alternative view that emphasizes subjective essence.\r\n\r\nCurator:  Yham Hameiri",

    "about": "On Saturday May 14th, 2016, Alfred – A Cooperative Institute for Arts and Culture, will open a group exhibition titled 'Flight Suit', which will feature the works of Monika Grabuschnigg (AT), Gil Naamati (IL), Moran Sanderovich (IL) and Avinoam Sternheim (IL). This exhibition is the fourth in the annual theme of 2016 –The Humane. The annual series will be divided into two sequences of exhibitions that attempt to examine the possible content of \"the humane\" as it is perceived today: 'the relations between the human and the divine' and 'the relations between the personal and the general'. Both sequences attempt to stress the concept of The Humane. All of the exhibitions stand alone, artistic and curatorial, but share a common concept.\r\nFlight Suit\r\nThe exhibition Flight Suit redefines the concept of the humane in our reality. The works of the participating artists include drawing, sculpture, video art and installation.\r\nThe exhibition works as a whole and simulates a metaphysical body, thus each artwork represents another system in the body:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSternheim uses ready-made objects to create tall scrap-like sculptures, which represent the skeleton of the body.\r\nSanderovich will exhibit sculptures made out of seemingly organic ready-made objects, which will represent the flesh of the body. The combination of the two works reflect the basic tension between the inflexible bones and the flaccid flesh.\r\nGrabuschnigg's sculpte​rs, displayed in a separate space, depict a dense inwardly movement, like inhaling air, which represent the lungs of the body.\r\nNaamati created a video montage displayed on four small TVs that add a narrative aspect to the exhibition, which is based on dialogue and conflict between two voices - male and female.\r\nThe entire exhibition will be built as an installation consisting of fragments representing one entity while creating a comprehensive viewing experience.\r\nCurator: Noa Elran",

Art as striving to emanate conceptual light,\r\ninterpretation or possible bearings to the often murky and foreboding current events as well\r\nas historic chronicles.\r\nHofshi’s mixed media work, including drawing, painting, printmaking and wood carving\r\ntechniques, create vivid striking imagery. The intertwined and formalistic blending also\r\nenhanced by expressive chiaroscuro compositions, further emphasize Hofshi’s call for\r\nreflection and observation.\r\nCurator: Ron Bartos\r\nOpening Reception: Thursday, 19.5, 20:00\r\nGallery Talk: Friday, 17.6, 12:00",

    "about": "In Ovid’s Metamorphoses, the goddess Minerva takes exception to the hubris of the mortal Arachne, a poor country girl who defiantly claims to be the superior weaver. Minerva, disguised as an old woman, appears to Arachne and suggests that the mortal offer forgiveness. When Arachne boastfully refuses, Minerva reveals herself and challenges the girl to a weaving contest. Minerva eventually wins and turns Arachne into a spider, thus relegating her to a life of spinning webs. Minerva wins this epic tale in which the reader finds the Manichean theme of man versus god, the capriciousness of fate, as well as the internal struggles of the creative process.\r\nWeaving has for centuries been considered a female occupation, and primarily a domestic talent, before being developed on an industrial scale. Fabric is produced by the interlacing of the warp, or the vertical component, and the woof, which comprises the horizontal filling.\r\nToday weaving and embroidery are used by mainstream artists as disparate as Louise Bourgeois, Tracey Emin, Francesco Vezzoli, and Andrea Zittel.\r\nWeaving is also slang for the telling of stories. The artists in this exhibition, like Arachne, tell stories that are bold and unapologetic. Although they come from far-flung parts of the world, they share common ground in creating their work without regard for commercial trends or mainstream expectations. Their creative processes are each anchored in traditional image making; however, their practices are idiosyncratic and move beyond the proverbial brush applying paint to canvas. From printing and stitching to burning, pouring, spraying, or using found imagery, each artist’s creative process is unique, and yet intersects and overlaps with others within the exhibition.",

    "authorDescription": "Angela Fraleigh- Fraleigh earned her MFA from Yale University and her BFA from Boston University. She has exhibited widely at numerous venues.\r\nFraleigh has been nominated for the Joan Mitchell Foundation Award, the Louis Comfort Tiffany grant, was awarded the Yale University Alice Kimball English Travel Grant as well as several international artist-in-residence programs, including the CORE program, MFAH, TX, the Bemis Center for Contemporary Art in Omaha, NE and Frans Masereel Centrum in Kasterlee, Belgium.  She is represented by Inman Gallery in Houston, TX and currently lives and works in New York, NY and Allentown, PA with her husband, artist Wes Heiss and their daughter Tuesday.\r\n \r\nBetty Tompkins- The large scale photorealistic paintings of heterosexual intercourse which Betty Tompkins made between 1969 and 1974 were practically unknown when they were exhibited together for the first time in New York in 2002. Knowledge of Tompkins’ paintings immediately broadened the repertoire of first generation feminist-identified imagery. More significantly, their materialization made manifest an unacknowledged precursor to contemporary involvement with explicit sexual and transgressive imagery.\r\n \r\nDaniella Sheinman-Israeli artist Daniella Sheinman (b. 1947) engages in painting and installation in her studio, located in a spacious hangar in Moshav Hemed. She is married and the mother of three.\r\nSheinman studied painting and sculpture at the Avni Art Institute, Tel Aviv between 1972 and 1975.  In the early 1990s Sheinman shifted to mixed media, working in pencil and graphite on canvas. These paintings were exhibited in 1994 at the Haifa Museum of Modern Art. Sheinman's unique language is the result of a painting technique that originates in sketches on small paper sheets akin to work plans.\r\n \r\nElham Rokni- Elham Rokni was born in Iran in 1980 and immigrated to Israel at the age of 9. She now lives and work in Tel Aviv. In 2007 she graduated with honors the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design in Jerusalem, in the Fine Arts Department, and in 2010 she completed her Master in Fine Arts degree in the Bezalel M.F.A program.\r\n \r\nMaria Berrio- Born in Bogotá, Colombia in 1982, Maria Berrio has been residing in New York City since 2000.\r\nShe currently works and lives in Brooklyn since obtaining her BFA at Parsons School of Design in 2004, and MFA at the School of Visual Arts in 2007.\r\nBerrio’s work has been showcased in numerous New York City galleries including Praxis International, Chelsea Museum, and the Art Directors Club.\r\nNationally, she has presented her work in San Francisco, Salt Lake City, Boston, and Miami – where she exhibited in Art Basel 2009.\r\n \r\nMaya Bloch-Born in Be'er Sheva, Israel in 1978, Bloch currently lives and works in Brooklyn, New York.

Her exhibitions were reviewed in The NYtimes, Frieze, Artforum, Art in America, Modern Painters, Huffington Post and The New York Observer.\r\n \r\nTschabalala Self-  Tschabalala Self is a New Haven based painter. She received her B.A. from Bard College in 2012 and her M.F.A. from the Yale School of Art in 2015.\r\n“My current body of work is concerned with the iconographic significance of the Black female body in contemporary culture. My work explores the emotional, physical and psychological impact of the Black female body as icon, and is primarily devoted to examining the intersectionality of race, gender and sexualty. Collective fantasies surround the Black body, and have created a cultural niche in which exists our contemporary understanding of Black femininity. My practice is dedicated to naming this phenomenon.”",

    "about": "\"The Balloon Catcher,\" features works created by Boyan during the last two years, which he spent in his homeland of Bulgaria. \r\nThe show is a painting installation created specifically for the gallery space. It includes around 50 oil-on-wood paintings in different sizes, featuring characters that Boyan paints repeatedly over the years. These include the pirate, the clown, the magician, and the freak, as well as horse riders from different eras and contexts – knights, cowboys, and Napoleons. These are all male heroes who become embedded in our cultural memory in early childhood. In Boyan's paintings, these characters look like dressed-up visitors, while his painterly work virtuously skips from one European genre to another. \r\nThe historical geopolitical realm ruled by the Christian Western Church, Europe is present in these paintings not only as a biographical or art-historical background, but also as the motherland of the original children's tales – the ones that came from the forest, that didn't get watered down yet by Disney or by our contemporary society's political correctness. Boyan depicts these legendary heroes through their dark, perverse, tragic-comic and sarcastic, European side, using painterly and installation means to highlight their relevancy to our contemporary world.\r\nBoyan says about his works featured in this exhibition: \"I create from within a parallel universe, which is my life during the past year and a half, following a drastic relocation with my family to my hometown of Vidin. It is a ghost city situated in an ex-communist country, on the banks of the Danube River. For a spectator coming from the Israeli/Western culture, the everyday life of Vidin can certainly seem like a parallel universe or some kind of fairytale, which contains the nights, castles and experiences I create in my recent paintings.\"\r\n\r\n*Born in Hungary in 1975, Boyan studied at Bezalel Academy in Jerusalem and in the SVA in New York. He has had solo exhibitions in The Herzelia Museum, Sommer Gallery and 39 Gallery in Tel Aviv. His works have been shown internationally in group exhibitions, in venues such as The Herzelia Biennial, The Haifa Museum, MoBY – Museums of Bat Yam, and Peter Kilchman Gallery in Zurich. His works are found in private and public collections in the UK, Switzerland, the US, and Israel.\r\nCurator: Leah Abir",

    "about": "/ Curator: Simcha Shirman\r\nA work of art; a poem; matter and a viewing body meet in a gallery space as an exhibition. This could be a familiar start to a folktale or a legend. Such an opening, simply describing things as they are, raises questions as to who is \"meeting\" – as such a meeting can be either planned or random; and as to the further development of the story – its significance and the relations between the participants. \r\nI am reminded of the words by Zen teacher Josho:\r\n\"If you ask what Josho teaches, say only – when it's cold, it's cold; and when it's hot, it's hot. \r\nThe poet Natan Alterman wrote:\r\n\"Not every line that hints\r\nThe city is a city, the street a street.\r\nThe light is light, the darkness as clear as daylight.\"\r\n\r\nJosho and Alterman, East and West, are saying that we can accept things as they are and need not insist on finding hidden intentions and meanings. But what is that acceptance? What is cold, what is hot, what does 'clear as daylight' mean? \r\nThe poem continues:\r\n\"The city is a city though it is clear that sometimes\r\nThe city is man, the man is time and the time is summer.\"\r\nLet us leave these things as they are, and get on with the story. I was recently introduced, at Bromide labs, to a new material and printing technique. It allows a photographic print to be made directly on aluminum (Metal Print). I was intrigued by this new option and curious to see how artists may creatively utilize this new technique in their artwork. I approached different artists and invited them to try integrating the technique into their work and into their unique visual language. \r\n\r\nMy love of poetry and my desire to create a quiet storm in the meeting of text and image led me to the poems of Hagit Grossman. Once she agreed to participate in this adventure; I asked the participating artists to choose one of her poems as a starting point for their work. \r\nThat is the idea. A clear idea. The clarity opens a space for the unexpected, the random. And the viewing body? The viewing body needs to partner with the sights and the sounds. It needs to see and to hear, to be open to an unending voyage in the streets of \"Invisible Cities\" (Italo Calvino) it needs to open, to take pleasure in the cold and the heat, the light and the dark. And when the deep understanding that the cold is cold and the heat is hot and the light is light and the dark is dark is reached, the consciousness will be free to ask what is the light, What is the dark, What is the cold, What is the heat. \r\n\r\nSomeone Else/Hagit Grossman\r\nEverywhere a hole is filled\r\nAny open space receives a sign\r\nA word and a silence. \r\nAnyone who stopped will say to stop\r\nAnyone who stopped will say that it’s impossible\r\nTo lean on it. \r\n(Translated by Benjamin Balint)\r\n\r\nSimcha Shirman, March 2016.\r\n\r\n(Translation of the text and Natan Alterman: Yoav Weiss)\r\n\r\nGallery Talk wiill take place on Saturday, April 9th at 11am",

    "authorDescription": "Since painting and drawing are essentially primitive and ancient art forms, I view them as a basis for an ever expanding and branching artistic practice. The painting process is, to me, a physical and mental process of remembrance, assumption, erasure, construction and deconstruction of personal, historical and collective sources into a new mixture of actions and qualities. \r\nMy work is set somewhere between urban-social art and a more traditional artistic practice within the studio. I am interested in contemporary Eastern art, that is connected to commonly repressed experiences and memories; art that overcomes the clichés of the here and now, and reveals hidden narratives.\r\nThe nature of my works is often intertwined with the space in which they are created –its structure, history and functionality become an essential part of my site-specific pieces, and even when working in more conventional art spaces, I strive for the piece to become one with its surroundings.\r\nwww.meydadeliyahu.com",

    "about": "What might you say is the relationship between language and bodies in Lior Modan’s new works?\r\nThis question gets to the heart of things but there is no one answer – no single organ, no privileged view. The body IS the imperfect body, the imprinted body, the sweaty body, the cold body, the faux body, the frozen-breaded body, the callous body, the sensitive body, the celestial body, and so on. Language is itself embodied, grandiloquent, deflated, matter of fact, romantic, robotic, a title, a fact, a fib, a highway, an exit, and so on. Language (in its remainder from body) -- crosses distances between, but also and more so is behind distance; inside; underneath. For example, if one were to insist on speaking with meaning without saying words, For with all-new-wrong-words, and persisted in keeping doing this until many things could be understood.",

Using her minimalist aesthetic, the exhibition focuses on the impact of light in both media and how the imprints of light signify the passing of time and speak to the physical and metaphysical mutability of memory itself.\r\nEfrati's point of departure are childhood memories from her grandparents’ apartment in Haifa: a faded reproduction of an iconic Romanian painting, a Rummikub game, the housing project itself. Efrati uses materials in her work that are characteristic of this typical apartment from the 1950s – 1960s: formica, terrazzo floors, mashrabyia tiles, and plastic shutters – materials that play with the permanence and mutability of light and create an overarching effect of warmth, and perhaps nostalgia, that challenges the objectivity demanded by the Minimalist aesthetic governing their design.\r\nCurator: Sergio Edelsztein",

    "about": "The artists in this exhibition are concerned with identity and place. Their very being becomes clouded when influences – ancestral as well as environmental – penetrate and demand recognition. Some of the Artists immigrated as children, others were born in Israel, a first generation or more. Yet – even after several generations of melding – we are still exposed to a gaze that labels us according to color, facial attributes, last names and accent.\r\nThe exhibition – in which all Artists belong to the same social group - presents a broad range of symbols and signs. It brings to the surface questions about seeking and yearning, influences, the possibility of choosing an identity,  holding on to stereotypes, about identity in Israel versus Europe today and Europe tomorrow and finally, the exhibition itself as a possible bridge.\r\nHadassa Cohen is concerned with phonetics and rhythm, inside and out. Roof tiles are wrapped in a tablecloth and a Swiss Artist recites in Hebrew. Her work, as a Canadian-born to a family that immigrated their from France and originates in Morocco, is dominated by alienation.\r\nDor Sharon shines a light on the trend of “localizing” names of plants and their related folk tales. The question of belonging roams above the kibbutz that was his home, his German passport from his father’s side and his Levantine appearance from his mother’s side.\r\nZaudito Yosef Seri uses traditional Ethiopian cloth and oscillates between white and black colors using plaster and charcoal, having a familiar smell – the only memory she has from there. She chose the local, but any stranger’s gaze marks her as “black”.\r\nDor Zlekha Levy performs digital manipulations that take us through three generations of Jewish-Arabic music Divas, for him a built-in part of being Israeli – certainly after the Friday afternoon Arabic movie that was a ritual in many homes.\r\nNoga Yudkovic-Etzioni uses an image of her grand mother’s pearl necklace to mark a path and to connect the generations. She is committed to pass on to her children the family memory that is linked to the Holocaust and to the bereavement of the Israeli wars. \r\nAdar Goldfarb brings together daily objects and brings them to life using loose low-tech mechanics. He uses humor to track his father’s sense of disconnectedness after immigrating in his youth from Argentine.\r\nMasha Rubin, Russian-born, plants scenes in the scenery. She photographs in Israel but obfuscates any specifics of location to create another place; sometimes another world.\r\nCurating: Rivka Kave & Dina Levy\r\nGallery talk featured Dr. Talya Sagiv will take place on Friday 8/4/16 at 12:00",

    "about": "The CCA presents a solo exhibition by Ragnar Kjartansson opening May 26, 2016 that will include iconic videos as well as a new body of paintings.\r\nRagnar Kjartansson creates durational performances, drawings, paintings, and video installations inspired by stage traditions, film, music, literature, and their histories. In any medium he uses, Kjartansson looks at pretending and staging as ways in which an artist can explore sincere emotion, employing romantic suffering and Weltschmerz. As stated in the catalogue of his exhibition at the New Museum: “Playing with stereotypes usually projected onto the persona of the actor, Kjartansson both celebrates and derides the romanticized figure of the artist as cultural hero. His performances are often feats of endurance, which last for hours or days at a time, taking a motif as simple as a pop song and transforming it through protracted repetition into a transcendent mantra.”\r\n\r\nFor his exhibition at the CCA, Kjartansson will create a new, ambitious body of paintings within the specific context of Israel. He will spend two weeks painting the urban landscapes in the West Bank “en plaine aire,” akin to his performative painting practice over the past few years. The paintings will be presented alongside two iconic video works by Kjartansson: A Lot of Sorrow (2013) and Song (2011).\r\n\r\nA Lot of Sorrow is a six-hour video made in collaboration with the band The National. It was filmed during a performance of the same name that was originally part of MoMA PS1’s Sunday Sessions in May 2013. The National played their three-minute, twenty-five second song “Sorrow” live on stage, repeatedly and continuously, for six hours.\r\n\r\nSong is also a six-hour video documenting a performance, made at the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburg in 2011. It features three young women endlessly repeating slightly misremembered phrases from Allen Ginsberg’s poem “Song,” set to melancholic guitar strumming. The image recalls ancient Greek myths of sirens and speaks to the neoclassical architecture of the museum.\r\n\r\nThe videos and paintings both address endurance and timelessness — whether the ongoing, deadlocked conflict that is the Occupation or the Romantic look at the emotional sublime. The vastness that is beyond any art’s ability to fully express can be both political and poetic. Kjartansson’s interest in music and his use of repetitive performance to harness collective emotion is a hallmark of his practice, and comes through in both the videos and the paintings that comprise “Architecture and Morality,” whose title comes from the 1981 hit record by OMD (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark).\r\n\r\nThe static, uneventful, yet visually rich videos can be considered durational images, even “films as paintings.” And the paintings, in turn, tell a story about the banality of everyday life amidst complex political turmoil. They are studies in and of themselves – exercises in oil on canvas of a situation beyond one’s grasp. The exhibition “Architecture & Morality” can be read from a number of angles, but ultimately it is a bold statement on art’s futility in the face of social and political strife.\r\n\r\nCurator: Chen Tamir",

    "about": "Hassid, who has focused on the worlds of young girls, teens, and adolescents for the last decade, now focuses her lens on \"young women\", Young Arab students, Hassid's neighbors in Ramat Aviv.\r\n\r\n Young generation of Arab women, removed from the environment where they have grown up, from the protection (often over-protection) of family, community, and tradition, nowin one o living f the strongholds of the Jewish elite in Israel.\r\nThe world of the young Arab women in Ramat Aviv is one of in-betweens. It follows school schedule, from arrival at the end of the weekend, with a small suitcase, until Thursday night, when they return to their families, most of whom live in homogeneous Arab towns or villages. This world exists between ancient traditions and the search for independence, for a personal voice, expression, style, and conduct. It is motivated by the urge to be who you are, and by doubts and worries that this identity – a young Arab woman in a Jewish city – invites daily confrontations with racism, suspicion, threats, and potential violence.\r\n\r\nHassid started working on this series more than two years ago, with the full cooperation of the girls photographed and after a long process of building trust.\r\n\r\nIris creates, through their portraits of their social life, a collage which does not receive, usually, enough attention.\r\n\r\n \"Tatriz to the Future\" is an aggregate of moments of life, portraits, places and meetings we have taught ourselves not to see, even though they are part of the fabric of our daily life in what used to be the village of Sheik Mounis.\r\nGallery Talk on Friday 24/6 at 12:00",

    "about": "The \"Water Marks\" exhibition, which brings to surface several never-before-seen works, focuses on water - the epicenter and fundamental motif of Maya Israel's latest compilation of paintings ebbs and flows conceptually past the edges of the canvases. The people, landscapes, plant-life, and sky depicted in the artwork are in a constant state of fluidity, embodying the inherent interplay between man and the universe. \r\n\r\nMaya Israel's painting technique comes to life in a multi-layered aesthetic of erasing, covering, and leaving the remains in view. The images depicted on the canvases lack defining features, leaving their identity untainted by time and place. Void of this confining narrative, reminiscent of the boundless nature of water, the artwork elicits the emergence of a universal memory that has been submerged beneath the depths of the unconscious. Rich in saturation, the long, pigmented, brush strokes transfix and guide viewers to slip into the fine wrinkle that separates reality from dream.",

    "about": "Adam Kaplan | Spoiled Inferno\r\nAdam Kaplan's first solo show explores the boundaries between memory, nostalgia and the contemporary moment. The works, scattered throughout the space, create a delicate, associative narrative that explores local cultural references, provincial myths and teenage fantasies, before and after the World Wide Web. The result is a hybrid space: club, office, and a teenager’s bedroom, which together tells a cultural coming-of-age story in the form of a forensic fiction. These are accompanied by a soundtrack of ’build-up‘ excerpts from early 2000s club-trance tracks – stuck in a loop of an ever intensifying crescendo, deprived of a climax.\r\n\r\n\r\nGabriella Klein/Massachusetts\r\nLarge-scale canvases that are larger than life, theatrical, describing what is closely, or too closely, observed. These paintings occur for the eye, rising in front of the eye and flirting with it. Each painting is like a scene from a play, a riddle, or rather the remainder of a riddle, a puzzle in a deaf mute language, a primal language that needs no words.",

    "about": "‘On the Decomposition of a Plane’ is the second solo show for artist Jan Tichy at Hezi Cohen gallery. \r\nTwo and a half years since his last stay in Israel, Tichy is back in Tel Aviv and back to the gallery space \r\nwhich he examined thoroughly in Installation no. 17, (2013), to provide an elusive foundation for the \r\ncreation of continuity and complementarity – the pentagon.\r\nIn a series of silk screen prints on paper – a new technique for Tichy’s body of work – the pentagon \r\nappears as the only polygon that does not surrender to form and decisively refuses an even tiling of a \r\nplane in various systems of entanglement and integrations opposed to fragmentation and \r\nconfrontation. \r\nIn each print the pentagon appears in one of fifteen types capable of tiling the plane monohedrally –\r\nthe finding of these types spreads over the last 100 years, starting with the German mathematician \r\nKarl Reinhardt who found the first five types in 1918 and ending with type 15 which emerged this year \r\nout of a computer generated search of the sum of possibilities.1\r\nTichy’s contribution to this two-dimensional riddle is a multi-layered monochromatic printing \r\ntechnique which adds a spectrum of depth to the plane and allows its representation in various stages \r\nof decomposition and deconstruction, layered in shades of black & grey, which adhere to the eleven \r\nstages of exposure and development that were formulated by the American photographer Ansel \r\nAdams in his ‘Zone System’.\r\nIn the upper space of the gallery Tichy returns to the sets of primitives - base units used to form a \r\nplane – six of them, one for each mathematician who discovered them – displaying emboss prints as a \r\npart of Installation no. 26, (2015). Printed on white paper – exemplifying primitive/primary visual \r\nrepresentations – these are placed outside the screening perimeter. The visibility of the embossed \r\nshapes within the prints is considered essential and relies on the constant variation of light and \r\nshadow in this space. The interdependence of three systems on a white plane: walls, emboss prints \r\nand the projected white light offer a deconstruction and a reinvention of the architectural space.\r\nQuestions of visibility, construction and decomposition arise out of the video Cricket (2015), \r\ndisplaying a cricket match occurring at dusk, which is played regularly in the municipal parking lot in \r\nfront of the gallery, two and a half years after it was documented by Tichy in his last stay in town. \r\nThe alternative activity hinders conventions concerning municipality and its citizens and exposes a \r\ndifferent order – weekend playground for a group of immigrants. This one hour long video work, \r\nwhich shifts between daylight to after dark, whilst echoing the outdoor sounds in the gallery space,\r\nconjures ideas of what is happening beyond the structured walls in relation to the shifting light within \r\nthe exhibition.",

    "about": "Resurrection and rectification are recurring motifs in the general exhibition, and are especially highlighted in the space of Contemporary by Golconda. “Fantastic man”, Beuys said about Yitzhak Danziger in a conversation between himself and Yona Fischer. A similar compliment was proffered when Micha Ullman met Beuys, who sent his regards to Danziger.[8] Beuys and Danziger met in August 1970. As a lecturer at Bezalel, Danziger had been invited by the German government for a tour of institutions of higher education in Germany. The ‘70s were highly productive for both artists, who were working almost in parallel. To a certain extent, Danziger predated Beuys with regards to the figure of the educator, the link with nature and the rectification of the landscape. In that encounter Danziger invited Beuys to teach at Bezalel, but following the Yom Kippur war Beuys canceled his trip.\r\n\r\nThe 1971 project of rehabilitating the Nesher Quarry was made in collaboration with students from the Haifa Technion. Danziger taught landscape architecture and believed in collaboration between science and art. Together with other researchers, he decided to try and rehabilitate an old quarry that had been left abandoned for many years and had ruined the outline of the mountain and the landscape. The destruction of the mountain, and its restructuring by Danziger and his students, led him to the understanding that nature had powerful sources of energy, which man had to study and hold a dialogue with. Understanding that the process of land art had no concrete and predefined end, Danziger built a three-part blueprint for action: a. do not restore nature to the way it was; b. use nature and its formations in a new way; c. find equilibrium between the demands of nature and the demands of art. Though partially executed, the rehabilitation project was ultimately curtailed for various reasons.\r\n\r\n“The artist’s responsibility in society is like that of an educator, a thinker, a rabbi, a father, a prophet and a preacher. He must preserve the things that have been done here. The artist should propose an idea, point to a direction, always flow like a river within society, plowing through the difficulties,”[9] Amnon Barzel quotes Danziger as saying in the last year of his life.",

    "about": "Curator: Leah Abir\r\nRawArt Gallery is happy to announce the opening of Lali Fruheling's new solo exhibition. A recent winner of the Ministry of Culture Young Artist Award, Fruheling is known for the installations she fabricates out of delicate materials such as nylon threads and paper, which she weaves into unique geographies and cosmologies. In \"Siren,\" her new solo show, Fruheling constructs yet another universe, which relates to the gallery space the way her paper cut flower gardens relate to the aquariums in which they are placed. One of the key components of this environment is a smashed and bitten car, which Fruheling handles in her typical formal language, setting an alternative to the mainstream macho use of auto parts and cars common in modern and contemporary art. Fruheling's smashed car sculptural installation is more akin in spirit to the sense of imminent doom characterizes the writings of Paul Virilio, who perceives the technological invention as the invention of its own catastrophe. Composed of manipulated objects and paper sculptures \"Siren\" is a scene mixing romanticism with catastrophe and glam. Similarly to her nylon string installations, the new exhibition follows formal structures and systems of decay, or nature's gnawing at man-made objects. Fruheling plays with light and hight, producing a setting that heightens both our sense of sight and orientation. The exhibition was produced with the support of the Israel Lottery Council for Culture and Arts Born in 1982, Lali Fruheling completed her MFA at the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design in Tel Aviv in 2012. Her primary media are installation and sculpture, and she works with various types of materials, including nylon threads, embroidery, and paper. Fruehling has had solo exhibitions at Raw Art Gallery, HaMeorav Gallery, and Darom Gallery in Tel Aviv. Her work has also been shown in various group exhibitions, in venues such as the Herzliya Museum of Contemporary Art, MoBY (Museums of Bat Yam), Jerusalem Drawing Biennial, Manofim Festival in Jerusalem, Bezalel Gallery in Tel Aviv, and Yaffo23 in Jerusalem.

    "about": "Curator | Hagar Bril\r\n\r\nWhere do we live?\r\n\r\nIn what ways do we define our sense of belonging to a given place?\r\n\r\nHow do we characterize our own habitat? In the formal ecological sense, habitat is defined as a set of environmental conditions that shape the life of an organism during its natural development. Driven by an instinct to survive, animals and humans alike adjust themselves to their environment, which in turn molds their development. But what is this inherent environment and what happens when we are torn apart from it? Can we keep calling our habitat ‘natural’ even while it includes things that are not of nature but made up of social processes, economic fluctuation, and industrial products that are completely synthetic? The artificial habitat that Miriam Naeh constructs in her exhibition attempts to create a platform for these type of investigations to take place.\r\n\r\nAt first glance it appears that what lies before us is a perfect and organic ecological environment: a thick forest of palm trees planted in an organized and deliberate fashion. And like any other constructed environment that exists primarily for the sake of its viewer, it is sprinkled with navigational signs and explanatory plaques, and provides pleasant opportunities for observing the common wildlife and surveilling the behaviors of the animals inside it.\r\n\r\nUpon closer inspection, however, a differentstory unfolds. As we begin our walk inside, the forest’s formality quickly disintegrates and we discover that this so-called ‘habitat’ is neither coherent nor organic. The palm trees are from the Jordan valley, yet the ground on which they stand is made of green-colored linoleum found in the stores of south Tel Aviv. In fact, even the trees themselves, considered so native to this land, are not truly native at all: they were brought to Israel during the first half of the 20th century from different countries for various agricultural and decorative purposes. Over time a range of palm species took hold and became a recognizable part of the landscape.\r\n\r\nThe signs placed alongside the forest path attempt to delegate meaning and order to the place - but this is a failed attempt; they reveal no new information but rather present altered imagery of local palm trees from ancient Egypt. The video works that flicker through the forest expose the daily activities and rituals of white and furry-like creatures that supposedly live inside it. We get a sense that we are spying on something important, reminiscent of some rare footage taken from the nature and travel channels on TV. The creatures themselves seem completely incompatible with their environment. They live inside white camouflage suits made for snowy terrains. Stripped from their original objective, these white suits offer no camouflage capabilities in this thick green forest. Instead of helping the creatures assimilate into their environment, they only accentuate their strangeness inside this place.\r\n\r\nThis hybrid habitat that Naeh has created fulfills itself through the appropriation of incohesive elements, bringing them together as a sort of unstable botanical garden; an ecological heterotopia that may or may not survive the test of reality. The artificial hybridization of the environment creates a habitat that is so disjointed and fragmented it is no longer comfortable to call it 'natural'. Standing in the presence of this transitional space, it is hard not to wonder: is every environment, even our own ‘natural’ habitat, one that we actually create for ourselves?\r\nHagar Bril\r\nTranslation by Leeron Tur-Kaspa\r\nGallery Talk will take place on Friday July 8 at 12:00",

The exhibition will display paintings from\r\n\r\nthe last two years, created out of thoughts about the medium of painting as an action space of the present , urgency\r\n\r\nAnd constant movement. The paintings range between the figurative and the and abstract, between expressive and sensual restrained\r\n\r\nAnd intellectual. The created repository does not attempt to describe a coherent reality and does not organize as a style or a research method.\r\n\r\nEach painting is an autonomous unit expressed out of its internal logic and the associates to the adjacent drawings through a context fabric, marking the space between the personal, cultural and political.\r\n\r\nOpening June 16th at 20:00\r\nGallery Talk will take place on Saturday July 9 at 12:00",

The characters in these paintings are taken from Shakine’s constant wandering around in different types of media: Facebook, Instagram, magazines, online etc. Shakine follows the fixed line of poses and postures in “selfie” images, sometimes adding a supplementary text. These works make up a fascinating document of life in present times.\r\n\r\nShakine’s works react in a powerful and inspiring way to the textual and visual culture of contemporary society, which is ruled by such values as success, social status, beauty, and sexuality.\r\nOpening Reception: Thursday, 7.7.2016 at 8pm",

    "about": "Curators: Tamarin Makarov and Talya Raz\r\nThis exhibition is the fifth in the annual theme of 2016 – The Humane. The annual series will be divided into two sequences of exhibitions that attempt to examine the possible content of \"the humane\" as it is perceived today: 'the relations between the human and the divine' and 'the relations between the personal and the general'. Both sequences attempt to stress the concept of The Humane. All of the exhibitions stand alone, artistic and curatorial, but share a common concept. \r\nForeground/ Background\r\nThe exhibition follows the breakdown and disintegration of a main character or image, which tends to attract the viewer's attention and is placed in the foreground. The various works, each in its own way, disassemble matter and image into their surroundings. The center of the artwork dissolves allowing the background to invade the foreground. The customary hierarchy of the main and the secondary is disrupted, thus multiple centers of power and interest arise in the artworks.\r\n\r\nArtists Tamarin Makarov and Talya Raz curated the exhibition around the theme of disintegration which occupies each in her own work processes. They gathered artists who could add more aspects to the subject through the medium with which they work. The exhibition will feature video, sculpture, painting and drawing.\r\n\r\nIn the video art of Liliana Farber, one gets the impression that the artist grinds the sea of text and images, which overwhelms us in the web feed of social networks, into flowing pixels on the screen. Farber highlights the infinite multiplicity, which we scroll through while we search for interest and excitement in the Internet, as an indigestible batter\r\n.\r\nKfir Shabat's sculptural material dissolves into the open space. A rusting recumbent wedding dress. The oxidation process of the material progresses throughout the exhibition.\r\n\r\nIn the video art of Gili Avissar the camera follows a character working through a creative process. The character is duplicated into a Kaleidescope-like pattern, making it difficult to recognize it as human.\r\n\r\nIn Talya Raz's paintings the images and the surroundings receive a similar treatment, thus the image seems to emerge from abstract color patches.\r\n\r\nAnother duplication process occurs in Tamarin Makarov's work: the road debris assembles into an amorphous form. The margins are gathered to the center.",

    "about": "Hezi Cohen Gallery is pleased to present 'If You Want a Horrible Place Say So,'  a new solo exhibition by Tsibi Geva, opening on Thursday, 30 June 2016 at 8 pm.\r\n\r\nThe exhibition will feature a selection of paintings from a large body of work produced by Geva in recent years. These works are “painting events”; they are created as an open-ended process, a journey to an undefined, undetermined destination. The works on view include abstract paintings as well as representations of the body and of physical and mental relationships.  \r\n\r\nThe paintings do not converge into a “theme.” Rather, they present a destabilizing, undermining impulse, an undercurrent which is often contrary to the images depicted. At the heart of these works is an erupting libidinal movement which splits, takes apart, and forms connections in unexpected manners. Geva’s paintings reject stylistic preconceptions and offer instead an act of painting in search of meaning, encompassing associations, rifts, and self-defacement; a painting undermining itself.\r\n\r\n“Painting thinks. How? This is an infernal question, perhaps inaccessible to the mind. We grope around.” \r\n-\tGeorges Didi-Huberman, La peinture incarnée, Editions de Minuit, 1985\r\n  The exhibition’s title is a quotation from Yona Wallach’s poem “If You Want a Place,” 1983.\r\nGallery Talk will take place on Friday.

    "about": "The exhibition deals with aspects of crises and obstacles, and brings together fourteen contemporary women artists from a variety of back-grounds, ages, and artistic media—all of whom operate out of an impulse to understand and express situations, traumas, pain, stresses and disturbing memories. The works actualize the essential internal contradiction that exists within the process itself—between artistic block or personal \"blockage\" and “creativity.” It is a contradiction stemming from the transition from skepticism, stagnation and fear—to hope, stimulation and challenge.\r\nThe “cage” image in the exhibition is a symbol of social protest against taboos and barriers of various kinds that have been imposed on women, on the pretext of protecting male society from the formidable power of feminine wiles and natural desire.\r\nThe issue of the Beauty Myth and body image is even more pronounced. The works are replete with expressions of old age, motherhood versus self-fulfillment, realizing personal potential, illnesses and loss. The artists’ recognition of barriers wherever they look impels them to turn these into instruments of creativity, personal development and liberation.\r\nThe curatorial decisions behind the exhibition were governed by the nature of the creative interpretation chosen by each artist in her transition from thinking about barriers and/or dealing with them, to the work itself. This raises for discussion not only issues of ars poetica, but also human, psychological, and social gender values.\r\nCurator: Dr. Nira Tessler\r\n*Dr. Nira Tessler is a lecturer and curator.

    "about": "Screen Penis\r\n\r\nTermed by Freud, the notionof a “screen memory”denotes a memory that links together a second-hand vision with a first-hand memory too difficult to bear – the residues of a memory that the psyche concedes to keep to itself (rather than the original).\r\n\r\nIn order to insure that they don’t disappear completely – where for Freud, the residue of such a traumatic memory might be a penis (for example) – this memory might be converted, regarding the difficulty, into pink-colored ice cream (for example). Yet it seems that in the current exhibition, this theory has gone awry. \r\n\r\n\r\nFrom a conversation with Merav:\r\n\r\nMichal: The painting/masturbating hand seems to flood the space with the image of one giant “screen penis”. It is as if the penis alone remains from the word “memory”. An utter and complete rift?\r\n\r\nMerav: Yes and I would like to stress the “as if”. Because it is perhaps precisely in the emptying-out of thebodily gesture, in the tracing, in a thin line, of the gesture and the bodily form, that the screened image comes to disclose itself. The exhibition tests the minor yet critical distances in the body’s map of its own borders, the blurred limits between what is proper and improper – such as a friendly kiss on the cheek that gravitates towards the mouth, or the story of Nahalal, an art teacher who wanted to cast his body and let the girls of his third-grade class apply plaster bandages onto his nearly naked body.\r\n\r\nThe drawings are somewhat like snapshots that direct our attention to physical contact, to a touch whose impact remainson the body like lasting archeological traces,however invisible. The exhibition deals with the substrata of gender power relations, with the rules that are unspoken yet largely accepted and that govern the perverted interplay between the sexes – an interplay that runs deepest. On the one hand, there is the clash of bodies trying to connect, a (physical or material) body that wants to connect with something greater, more metaphysical. But on the other hand, the body is used as a vessel.\r\nI have tried to dissolve all this into dust, to make it disintegrate and vanish, through the Sisyphean task of making these works. I wanted to cover the walls with paintings,like the walls of a church. To create something of a temple to sexual experience, to offer a journey into the deep recesses of sex and to render the body,penetrated, by conquering the walls. I wanted for this interior,where the viewer or sex partner enters, to be inscribed with all previous experiences, with everything the viewers would rather not know, everything that is unspoken and deemed to silence.\r\nMichal Heiman, June 2016",

    "about": "Contemporary Gallery presents a solo exhibition of nature and landscape paintings by the designer and artist Avi Eisenstein, a professor at the Bezalel Academy.\r\n\r\n“I paint with a ‘different sky’ above me,” Eisenstein says. “The sky in each of my paintings is lit by a last light, a sunset light which separates the views of the land below it.”\r\n\r\nThis remnant of light reveals the landscape in his paintings as unidentified marks, as an ambiguous, enigmatic image, deliberately precluding any clear conceptual deciphering. The landscape images in the paintings are severed from their connection to a physical place, disengaged from what the concept of “landscape” means in its geographical contexts.\r\nInstead, Eisenstein presents landscapes in a chaotic state of becoming, when the earth is still alluvial, anguished and restless.\r\n\r\nA central motif in the nature paintings featured in the exhibition is a light-darkness relationship that, in Eisenstein’s conception of painting, parallels the relationship between covering and unveiling, memory and forgetting, reality and delirium.\r\nThe light in the series of landscapes shown in the exhibition may be called a “painterly light” – a sublimative light whose place in the painting stems from painterly considerations unrelated to any natural light source such as a sun or a moon. \r\nEisenstein associates this painterly position – seeing painting as illusion, as chimera – with Nietzsche’s definition of illusion as “a primitive stage, far older, far more fundamental than the aesthetic stage”.\r\n\r\n“The paintings in the exhibition respond to and rely on a familiarity with a long tradition of movements  and painters in art history – Caravaggio, Goya, Caspar David Friedrich, Gustave Courbet and Munch are only a few of the mentors who have shown me to what extent light is essential to nature and landscape paintings, and to what extent the artist’s worldview and his approach to light influence the way in which the viewer is supposed to decipher the painting’s meaning and messages,” says Eisenstein.\r\n\r\n“Painting starts where the words end. Painting is inherently an act of silence, an act performed in silence. This is the source of its magic, and also why one deliberates when choosing a name for an exhibition, which is supposed to represent the conceptual meaning of images.\r\nBefore I begin each of my paintings, I try to understand the meaning of the relationship that might connect me to the painting’s subject. Can I express moods and feelings through painting a tree trunk. Is it possible to paint the tree as both a tree and a self-portrait.”",

    "about": "On Thursday July 21, 2016, Alfred – A Cooperative Institute for Arts and Culture, will open a double exhibition titled ‘Humanoid’, which will feature the works of Boris Yuhvetz and Miriam Yuhvetz \r\nThis exhibition will be the sixth in the annual theme of 2016 – The Humane. The annual series will be divided into two sequences of exhibitions that attempt to examine the possible content of \"the humane\" as it is perceived today: 'the relations between the human and the divine' and 'the relations between the personal and the general'. Both sequences attempt to stress the concept of The Humane. All of the exhibitions stand alone, artistic and curatorial, but share a common concept. \r\nHumanoid\r\nBoris and Miriam Yuhvetz, father and daughter, will exhibit new works created especially for the exhibition, mostly gouache (Boris) and acrylic (Miriam) paintings of various sizes, along with an installation composed of small sculptures.\r\nHumanoid is a term derived from biology, and relates to a figure with unique human characteristics. The term refers to creatures from various fields such as robots, hybrid creatures of popular mythologies, aliens in various works of science fiction, and gnomes, trolls and the like in works of fantasy.\r\nThe exhibition presents two surprising perspectives on the human image, one personal and the other cosmopolitan. Both attentive forecasts predicting the future, through humor and in search for the humane.\r\nBoris Yuhvetz: \"From an early age, I had a feeling that I was surrounded by humanoids. As a small boy, I watched the Soviet Union recovering from World War II. As a young man, as I watched the impossible politics of Europe of the twentieth century, extreme personalities like Hitler and Stalin, seemed like they were not ordinary human beings. I saw them as human-like creatures that influenced the masses, who seemed humanoids as well, capturing them in the enchantment of murderous ideologies.\r\nThen I found interest in science fiction films, which began to be shown in the Soviet Union during the sixties, presenting monsters and other humanoid creatures. The humanoid as a concept grew into more aspects: artistic and literary, at that time I began to think seriously about art.\"\r\nMiriam Yuhvetz: \"The use of the word humanoid produces perhaps an expectation to see something mechanical, technological, cold and aloof. My intention is to create a colorful figurative experience that will primarily cause people to smile. I look for the connection between the computer and its human extension, where I try to identify the elusive boundaries between man and machine. I try to embed relaxing contents into that threatening concept, to treat it as a playful thing and thereby blocking the idea that the world is being taken over by humanoids.",

    "about": "One More Round' is Fahed Halabi's first solo show at RawArt Gallery, and it takes place 6 years after the artist's last solo show in Israel. This exhibition contains paintings and video works that predominantly revolve around the theme of the construction site. Functioning in a way that differs from conventional representations of this motif within the history of art created in Israel, the construction site in Halabi's works is revealed as a dead-end political absurd.\r\n\"How Much is a Construction Worker's Life Worth?: 6000 NIS and a Few Months of Community Service\" cries a headline of an article in 'Haaretz' newspaper which deals, once more, with the tragic and disregarded deaths of construction workers, many times a result of a long fall off a crane or a scaffolding. The construction site is an arena in which the inhumane sides of capitalism and ideology meet. In recent years, both in Israel and around the world, it became an emblem of social and economic polarization characterizing contemporary society, revealing the crimes behind this polarization at their utmost glory.  As such, it also became a site around which social and cultural protests could revolve.\r\nFor many years now, Halabi has been looking into the forms and structures of the construction site, as well as into the social relations that it forges. He depicts its machines and materials using realistic and formalist strategies, extracting these elements from a specific place, isolating them and placing them in an aesthetic territory which contains pop, hyper and symbolist coordinates, without easily falling into either stylistic category. In Halabi's works, grids of floor tiles and sky-crossing cranes trace the outlines of the construction site as if it was the world in its entirety, while generating a second political absurd, in which the action of painting follows that of the construction worker's.\r\nFahed Halabi writes about this series of works: \"It is an attempt to confront the aesthetic dimensions of a place which seems to be lacking any sense of aesthetics; an attempt to discuss class and socio-economical political conditions, in the context of the power relations that make up contemporary work. These power relations are economically allied to the reality of a colonial state. One cannot ignore the uneven relationships these structures form, which could be compared to a master-slave relations, even though they fit so nicely into contemporary market rules … The method of painting I apply in this series not only lacks the excitement of expressionistic gestures, but it also excludes the human factor – a basic stimulator of emotional identification. It's as if these paintings are fragments that exist independently and separately from the person that created them, and that have the power to represent themselves. To conclude, I was trying to create a parallel between the value of work in two different fields: art, and construction work.\r\nCurator: Leah Abir\r\nGallery Talk with the artist and curator will tale place on Saturday, August 13 at 12:00",

    "about": "Curated by Sergio Edelsztein\r\nOpening: Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 8 pm\r\nThe CCA presents “Nesting,” a solo exhibition by Gaston Zvi Ickowicz that explores construction processes and nesting and raises questions as to their affinity with the establishment of nationality, tradition, and cultural identity.\r\nAt the center of the exhibition is the five-channel HD video installation, The City of Rawabi (2016). Each of the five screens depicts a single stonemason as he chisels the local stones used to clad the buildings of the first modern Palestinian city in the West Bank with a “traditional” facade.\r\nThe Planting (2013-2016) photo series was taken during mass planting events organized in Israel by the Jewish National Fund. Images of planted tree saplings signify a moment of inception or promise, yet also represent events whose ideological meaning unmistakably points to claiming ownership of the land by and for Jews.\r\nFor the Embroidery Patterns (2016) series Ickowicz scanned and enlarged patterns from the book Jerusalem in Needlepoint and Embroidery by Ann Roth (published in Hebrew in 1972 and in English in 1973). The book of embroidery patterns of historical and holy sites of Jerusalem was handed out as a gift to employees Maskit, a prominent Israeli fashion house. Ickowicz’s appropriation not only exposes the ideological use of these patterns, which is not surprising considering the Zionist narrative of the time, but it also points to the images as part of production, reproduction, and craftwork processes, and consequently asks not just what the meaning of the image is, but also what does it do or how does it act. Here, photography no longer functions as representation, but rather as a practice. \r\nThe Chronicle of Change (2016) photo series is the outcome of the artist’s prolonged research of philatelists and collectors of Palestinian postage stamps. It comprises images from four series of stamps that contain traces of processes of appropriation, erasure, and assimilation that make evident the ways by which images take part in the struggle for building a national homeland, and the symbolic significance they gain in the process of establishing sovereignty and gaining independence.\r\nChronicle of Change conceptually stamps the exhibition, which presents a shift from the notion of photography as representation to one of photography as action – an action through which an image turns into a material object that, disseminated in public, gains new meaning and usage every time it is relayed to new viewers. The exhibition invites us to follow the direct connection it draws between nesting and individual or national processes of establishment, building, and development.\r\nThe launch of the exhibition catalogue, with articles by Sergio Edelsztein and Gilad Reich, will take place on September 1st at 7pm.",
